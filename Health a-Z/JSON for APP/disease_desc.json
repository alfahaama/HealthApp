In reaction, providers must decide how to limit Medicare patient volumes, find efficiencies in the treatment of Medicare volumes, or eliminate chosen services to Medicare patients all together.: As revenues are further jeopardized, providers must look closer at controllable expenditures and question the return on dollars spent. Providers must consider the value gap as well -- where cost increases have outpaced the increases of quality of care. Stakeholders are demanding better quality at lower costs and providers must respond accordingly.: In response to reductions in revenue and expenses, providers must improve outcomes, reduce redundancies, and find alternative delivery models to treat patients in more economical manners with minimal or no sacrificing of patient outcomes.: One of the most highly publicized sources of the ACA's potential economic impact is the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), the 15-member board of unelected health-care experts designed to provide Congress with cost-cutting recommendations when Medicare spending hits a certain level. The IPAB, a panel of nonelected health-care experts, became the bogeyman of the ACA in 2009 when Sarah Palin touted the IPAB as the death panel. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects IPAB will save Medicare $16 billion over 10 years and, by necessity, a subset of providers would receive the brunt of the cuts. IPAB is not permitted to recommend changes to beneficiary premiums, cost-sharing, or eligibility rules.

Most joints can extend more than normal. For example, the knees can hyperextend beyond the normal stopping point. Not all joints are lax in this way. To the contrary, extension and rotation of the elbow are abnormally limited. Hip extension also tends to be limited.At birth there is often prominence of the mid-to-lower back with a small gibbus (a hump). With, the hump goes away and a pronounced sway (lordosis) of theregion (the lower back) becomes apparent. The lumbar lordosis is persistent into adulthood.  The legs are bowed (genu varum).The baby exhibits some decrease in muscle tone (hypotonia). Because of the large head, especially compared to rest of the body, and the decreased muscle tone, the child with achondroplasia will run behind schedule in reaching the usual motor developmental milestones. The schedule to which an achondroplastic child's development should be compared is not that for all children in the general population, but rather the growth charts and timetable followed by children with achondroplasia.Intelligence is generally normal in patients with achondroplasia. Enlargement of the brain (megalencephaly) is common and normal with achondroplasia." ,

The ruptured Achilles tendon prevents the power from the calf muscles to move the heel.Whenever the diagnosis is missed, the recovery is often prolonged.Bruising and swelling around the calf and ankle occur.Achilles tendon rupture is frequent in elderly individuals who have a sedentary lifestyle and suddenly become active. In these individuals, the tendon is not strong and the muscles are deconditioned, making recovery more difficult.Achilles tendon rupture has been reported after injection of corticosteroids around the heel bone or attachment of the tendon. The fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin [Cipro]) is also known to cause Achilles tendon weakness and rupture, especially in young children.Some individuals have had a prior tendon rupture that was managed conservatively.

This weakness resolves after delivery. In addition the growing uterus can also put pressure on the stomach and push acid into the esophagus.Foods that can cause heartburn during pregnancy include chocolate, peppermint, caffeinated beverages (such as coffee, tea, and soft drinks), fatty foods, and alcohol.Heartburn during pregnancy can usually be managed with changes in, lifestyle, and habits.If lifestyle changes do not resolve the heartburn during pregnancy, a doctor may recommend antacids, but these should be used only under a doctor's supervision. Antacids may reduce the absorption of iron in the, and magnesium-containing antacids could slow labor. Consult your doctor before taking any medications, even over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, while you are pregnant.Tums are considered safe to take during pregnancy for heartburn relief. Tums also contains calcium, which pregnant women need. Take it at a different time than any iron supplements you take.Other over-the-counter (OTC) medications including antacids (Rolaids, etc.), H2 blockers such as ranitidine (Zantac) or cimetidine (Tagamet), or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can also be taken during pregnancy.Because heartburn during pregnancy is thought to be caused by pregnancy hormones, heartburn will usually go away after delivery and no further treatment is needed.Fun fact: there is an old wives' tale that heartburn during pregnancy means your baby will have a full head of hair. This is actually true! The heartburn itself doesnt cause the hair growth, rather, estrogen levels during pregnancy cause the esophageal sphincter to relax, which allows stomach acid to back up into the esophagus, resulting in heartburn. The estrogen plays a role in hair growth in the developing baby." ,

"Acute Hepatitis B (Hepatitis B)" : "Thevirus is a DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family of.B virus is not related to thevirus or thevirus.Some people withB never clear the virus and are chronically infected. Approximately 2 billion individuals in the world have evidence of past or present hepatitis B, and 2.2 million people in the U.S. are chronically infected with hepatitis B. Many of these people appear healthy but can spread the virus to others.Hepatitis B infection is transmitted through sexual contact, contact with contaminated blood (for example, through shared needles used for illicit, intravenous drugs), and from mother to child. Hepatitis B is not spread through food, water, or casual contact.Serologic (blood) markers specifically for hepatitis B virus are used to diagnose hepatitis B viral infection. The blood tests can also identify the stage of the infection (past or present) and people who are at highest risk for complications.Injury to theby hepatitis B virus is caused by the body's immune response as the body attempts to eliminate the virus.In the United States, 95% of adults who get hepatitis B are able to clear the virus and cure themselves of infection. The remaining 5% of adults with acute hepatitis B go on to develop chronic hepatitis B. Those who acquire the infection in childhood are much more likely to have chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B may lead toor liver failure. Approximately 15% to 25% of people with chronic infection will die prematurely as a result of the infection.Progression of chronic hepatitis B viral infection occurs insidiously (subtly and gradually), usually over several decades. The course is determined primarily by the age at which the hepatitis B viral infection is acquired and the interaction between the virus and the body's immune system.Treatment with current antiviral drugs suppresses viral reproduction in about 40% to 90% of patients with chronic hepatitis B. The medications are also effective in reducing inflammation and improving blood tests. This can delay or reduce complications such as cirrhosis. However, only about 50% of people achieve a sustained viral suppression, and relapse is common. The medications do not cure the infection.Liver transplantation should be considered for patients with impending liver failure due to acute (initial) infection or advanced cirrhosis.Hepatitis B is preventable through vaccination. All children should receive the vaccine. In addition, adults at high risk for hepatitis B should be vaccinated. Unvaccinated people who are exposed to hepatitis B should be evaluated by a physician to determine if they need specific immune globulin (HBIG)." ,
"Acute Compartment Syndrome (Compartment Syndrome)" : "describes increased pressure within a muscle compartment of the arm or leg. It is most often due to injury, such as fracture, that causes bleeding in a muscle, which then causes increased pressure in the muscle. This pressure increase causes nerve damage due to decreased blood supply.Symptoms include severe, numbness, and decreased range of motion.Surgery (fasciotomy) is the only treatment for acute compartment syndrome. The muscle compartment is cut open to allow muscle tissue to swell, decrease pressure and restore blood flow.Complications may include muscle loss, amputation, infection, nerve damage, and.efforts include ice and elevation of the affected extremity.Chronic compartment syndrome usually requires no treatment or surgery." ,

"Acute Lung Injury (ARDS)" : "ARDS, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a lung condition that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood. ARDS can be life threatening. This is because your body's organs, such as the kidneys and brain, need oxygen-rich blood to work properly.Most people who develop ARDS are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe. If you have trouble, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 911.In ARDS, infections, injuries, or other conditions cause the lung's tiny blood vessels to leak more fluid than normal into the' air sacs. This prevents the lungs from filling with air and moving enough oxygen into the bloodstream.Some common conditions and factors that can lead to ARDS are,, severe bleeding caused by an injury, an injury to the chest or head, breathing in harmful fumes or smoke, and inhaling vomited stomach contents from the mouth.People at risk for ARDS have a condition or illness that can directly or indirectly injure their lungs.The first signs and symptoms of ARDS are feeling like you can't get enough air into your lungs, rapid breathing, and low oxygen levels in the blood. Other signs and symptoms depend on the cause of the condition. They may occur before ARDS develops.Your doctor will diagnose ARDS based on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results from tests.ARDS is treated with oxygen therapy, fluids, and medicines. Treatments are done in a hospital's intensive care unit. Patients who have ARDS may develop other medical problems while in the hospital. The most common problems are infections,(collapsed lung), lung scarring, and.Some people fully recover from ARDS. Others continue to have health problems. These problems may include shortness of breath,and muscle weakness,, and problems with memory and thinking clearly.You can take steps to recover from ARDS and improve your quality of life. Ask your family and friends to help with everyday activities. Don't smoke and avoidand other lung irritants, such as harmful fumes. Go to pulmonary rehabilitation if you doctor recommends it. Join a support group for ARDS. Seek help from your health care team if you feel depressed.ARDS treatment has improved in recent years. As a result, more people are surviving ARDS. Researchers are studying new treatments for the condition." ,

"Addiction (Drug Abuse)" : "Drug abuse and addiction, now both grouped as drug use disorder, is a condition that is characterized by a self-destructive pattern of using a substance that leads to significant problems and distress, which may include tolerance to or withdrawal from the substance.Drug use disorder is unfortunately quite common, affecting more than 8% of people in the United States at some point in their lives.Dual diagnosis refers to the presence of both a drug-use issue in addition to a serious mental-health condition in an individual.Virtually any substance whose ingestion can result in a euphoric (high) feeling can be abused.Inhalants like household cleaners are some of the most commonly abused substances.While the specific physical and psychological effects of drug use disorder tend to vary based on the particular substance involved, the general effects of a substance use disorder involving any drug can be devastating.Although drug use disorders have no single cause, there are a number of biological, psychological, and social risk factors that can predispose a person to developing a chemical use disorder.Symptoms of a drug use disorder include recurrent drug use that results in legal problems, occurs in potentially dangerous situations, interfere with important obligations, results in social or relationship problems, tolerance, withdrawal, using a lot of the drug or for a long period of time, persistent desire to use the drug, unsuccessful efforts to stop using the drug, neglecting other aspects of life because of their drug use, and spending inordinate amounts of time or energy getting, using, or recovering from the effects of the drug.While the specific effects of drugs on the brain can somewhat vary depending on the drug that is being used, virtually every substance that is abused has an effect on the executive-functioning areas of the brain. Drugs particularly affect the brain's ability to inhibit actions that the person would otherwise delay or prevent.Since there is no single test that can definitively diagnose someone with a chemical use disorder, health-care professionals assess these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental-health information, as well as securing a physical examination and lab tests to assess the sufferer's medical state.Treatment services for drug use disorders remain largely underutilized by most people who suffer from these conditions.The primary goals of recovery are abstinence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation.During the initial stage of abstinence, a person who suffers from chemical dependency may need detoxification treatment to help avoid or lessen the effects of withdrawal.Often, much more challenging and time-consuming than recovery from the physical aspects of addiction is psychological addiction.The treatment of dual diagnosis seems to be more effective when treatment of the sufferer'sis integrated with the treatment of the individual's chemical dependency.Drug addiction increases the risk of a number of negative life stressors and conditions, particularly if left untreated.Recovery from a substance use disorder is usually characterized by episodes of remission and relapse." ,
"Addison Anemia (Pernicious Anemia)" : "Pernicious anemia is defined as a type of vitamin B12 deficiency that results from impaired uptake of vitamin B-12 due to the lack of a substance known as intrinsic factor (IF) produced by the stomach lining.Pernicious anemia is a condition caused by too little vitamin B12 in the body. It is one form of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia.Vitamin B12 helps the body make healthyand helps keep nerve cells healthy. It is found in animal foods, including meat, fish, eggs, milk, and other dairy products.The most common cause of pernicious anemia is the loss of stomach cells that make intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor helps the body absorb vitamin B12 in the intestine. The loss of parietal cells may be due to destruction by the body's own immune system.Pernicious anemia can cause permanent damage to nerves and other organs if it goes on for a long time without being treated. It also raises the risk for developing.Common signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, seen in pernicious anemia are:Pernicious anemia is diagnosed using family history and medical history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests and procedures.Pernicious anemia is easy to treat with vitamin B12 pills or shots as well aschanges. Life-long treatment is needed.Complications caused by untreated pernicious anemia may be reversible with treatment.Doctors don't know how to prevent pernicious anemia that is caused by the immune system destroying stomach cells.Eating foods high in vitamin B12 and folic acid can help prevent vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a poor." ,

Nonparaphilic addictions are classified by the() as sexual disorder, not otherwise specified.No one factor is thought to cause sexual addiction, but there are thought to be biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to the development of these disorders.Sex addicts have been described as suffering from a negative pattern of sexual behavior that leads to significant problems or distress.As is true with virtually any other mental-health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has a sexual addiction. Therefore, health-care practitioners diagnose these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental-health information to distinguish sexual addiction from medical and other mental-health disorders.Many people with a sexual addiction benefit from the support and structure of recovery groups or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). When sexual compulsions become severe, the sufferer may require inpatient treatment or participation in an intensive outpatient treatment program.Seroetoninergic (SSRI) antidepressants, antiseizure medications, naltrexone, and medications that decrease male hormones have been found to decrease the compulsive urges and/or impulses associated with sexual addictions for some sufferers.The prognosis of sexual addictions depends on a number of factors.of sexual addiction may involve interventions that enhance self-esteem and self-image, addressing emotional problems, educating children about the dangers of excessive internet use, monitoring and limiting computer use, and screening out pornographic sites.Sex addiction is associated with a number of potential medical, occupational, legal, social, and emotional complications.Research on sexual addiction includes exploring potential risk factors and developing accurate screening and assessment tools for these disorders." ,

"Ageusia (Taste Disorders)" : "The most common taste disorder is phantom taste perception, which is a lingering, often unpleasant taste even though you have nothing in your mouth. Another type of taste disorder is hypogeusia, a reduced ability to taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and savory (umami). Dysgeusia is a condition in which a foul, salty, rancid, or metallic taste sensation will persist in the mouth. Ageusia is the inability to detect any tastes, which is rare.Often, people who feel they have a problem with their sense of taste are experiencing a loss of smell instead of a loss of taste.Some people are born with taste disorders. Other causes include upper respiratory andinfections,for cancers of the head and neck, exposure to certain chemicals, some antibiotics and antihistamines,, surgery to the ear, nose, and throat, poor oral hygiene, and dental problems.Many types of taste disorders are curable when the underlying cause is diagnosed. If a medication is the cause, adjusting or changing the medication may help. If the taste disorder is due to an upper respiratory infection or, once the condition is treated, the sense of taste returns to normal. Proper oral hygiene can also resolve some taste disorders.If you lose some or all of your sense of taste you can make your food taste better by preparing foods with a variety of textures, and using herbs and hot spices." ,

"Agoraphobia" : "Agoraphobia is a fear of being outdoors or otherwise being in a situation from which one either cannot escape or from which escaping would be difficult or embarrassing.Like other, agoraphobia often goes unreported, probably because manysufferers find ways to avoid the situations to which they are phobic.Agoraphobia often co-occurs with.Agoraphobia occurs alone in less than 1% to nearly 7% of the population, more often in girls and women compared to boys and men.There are a number of theories about what can cause agoraphobia, including a response to repeated exposure to-provoking events or a reaction to internal emotional conflicts.As with other mental disorders, a number of factors usually contribute to the development of agoraphobia, it tends to run in families, and for some people, there may be a clear genetic factor involved in its development.Symptoms of agoraphobia include anxiety and resulting avoidance of being in a situation in which one will have a, when in a situation from which escape is not possible, or is difficult or humiliating.Theassociated with agoraphobia, like all panic attacks, may involve intense fear, disorientation, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat,, or.The situations that people with agoraphobia avoid and those cause people withto feel disoriented are sometimes quite similar, leading some cases of agoraphobia to be consideredfunction agoraphobia.Agoraphobia tends to begin by adolescence or early adulthood.Suffering from any otherincreases the risk of developing agoraphobia.Symptoms of agoraphobia should be treated when the signs and symptoms of the associated anxiety are not easily, quickly, and clearly relieved.Physicians often diagnose and treat agoraphobia when patients seek treatment for other medical or emotional problems rather than as the primary reason that care is sought.To assess for agoraphobia, the treating psychiatrist or other physician will usually take a careful history, perform or refer to another doctor for a physical examination, and order laboratory tests. The presence of any medical condition or other emotional problem will be explored.Cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy are the most effective psychotherapies that treat agoraphobia.Medications like SSRIs, beta-blockers, and benzodiazepines most commonly treat agoraphobia. The risk of overdose,, or need for increasingly higher doses (tolerance) make benzodiazepines a less desirable treatment for agoraphobia.Agoraphobia increases the likelihood that the person also suffers from another anxiety disorder and that both conditions will be more severe and difficult to treat.Agoraphobia tends to occur more often in individuals who have a number of different physical conditions.If left untreated, agoraphobia may worsen to the point where the person's life is seriously impacted by the disease itself and/or by attempts to avoid or hide it." ,

Rather, it is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors.There is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has an alcohol-use disorder.  Therefore, health-care professionals diagnose these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental-health information.There are thought to be five stages of alcoholism, the more severe end of the alcohol use disorder spectrum.There are numerous individual treatments for alcoholism, including medical stabilization (detox), individual and group counseling, support groups, residential treatment, medications, drug testing, and/or relapse-programs.Some signs of a drinking problem include drinking alone, to escape problems, or for the sole purpose of getting drunk; hiding alcohol in odd places; getting irritated and/or craving alcohol when you are unable to obtain alcohol to drink; and having problems because of your drinking.While some people with more severe alcohol use disorder (formerly alcoholism or alcohol dependence) can cut back or stop drinking without help, most are only able to do so temporarily unless they get treatment.There is no amount of alcohol intake that has been proven to be generally safe during.The long-term effects of alcohol abuse and alcoholism can be devastating and even life-threatening, negatively affecting virtually every organ system.Codependence is the tendency to interact with another person in an excessively passive or caretaking manner that negatively affects the quality of the codependent individual's life.Adequate supervision and clear communication by parents about the negative effects of alcohol and about parental expectations regarding alcohol and other drug use can significantly decrease alcohol use in teens.With treatment, about 70% of people with alcoholism are able to decrease the number of days they consume alcohol and improve their overall health status within six months." ,

There are also genetic and other risk factors.Characteristicandof Alzheimer disease includeSymptoms may be present in varying degrees of severity.The cause(s) of Alzheimer's disease is (are) not known. Although, accumulation of the protein amyloid in the brain is suspected to play a role.The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease should be based on a comprehensive examination that rules out other causes of.There are numerous causes of, so having the characteristic symptoms do not necessarily mean that a person has Alzheimer disease.The treatment and management of Alzheimer's disease consists of medications and non-medication based treatments.The apoE gene has three different forms (alleles) -- apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4.The apoE4 form of the gene has been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in most (but not all) populations studied.The frequency of the apoE4 version of the gene in the general population varies, but is always less than 30% and frequently 8% to 15%.People with one copy of the E4 gene usually have about a two- to three-fold increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.Persons with two copies of the E4 gene (usually around 1% of the population) have about a nine-fold increase in risk.Nonetheless, even persons with two copies of the E4 gene don't always get Alzheimer's disease.At least one copy of the E4 gene is found in 40% of patients with sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease.()Possibly elevated bloodIndividuals who have completed less than eight years of education also have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. These factors increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but by no means do they mean that Alzheimer's disease is inevitable in persons with these factors.A majority of people withwill develop the brain changes of Alzheimer's disease by 40 years of age.

"Alzheimer's Disease Patient Caregiver Guide" : "Ask the doctor any questions you have about. Find out what treatments might work best to alleviate symptoms or address behavior problems.Contact organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center for more information about the disease, treatment options, andcaregiving resources. Some community groups may offer classes to teach, problem-solving, and management skills. See For More Information below to contact the ADEAR Center and a variety of other helpful organizations.Find a support group where you can share your feelings and concerns. Members of support groups often have helpful ideas or know of useful resources based on their own experiences. Online support groups make it possible for caregivers to receive support without having to leave home. The Alzheimer's Association and other organizations sponsor support groups.Study your day to see if you can develop a routine that makes things go more smoothly. If there are times of day when the person with Alzheimer's is less confused or more cooperative, plan your routine to make the most of those moments. Keep in mind that the way the person functions may change from day to day, so try to be flexible and adapt your routine as needed.Consider using adult day care or respite services to ease the day-to-day demands of caregiving. These services allow you to have a break while knowing that the person with Alzheimer's is being well cared for.Begin to plan for the future. This may include getting financial and legal documents in order, investigating long-term care options, and determining what services are covered by health insurance and Medicare." ,

The antibiotics are believed to suppress normal colonic bacteria that usually keepfrom multiplying and causing colitis.Most cases ofcolitis occur in patients in the hospital, but the number of cases that occur among individuals not having been in or recently discharged from the hospital has increased greatly.The primary means of diagnosing C.difficile colitis is by testing for the bacterial toxins in samples of stool.The treatment ofcolitis is with antibiotics, primarily vancomycin and metronidazole. Up to 10% of patients do not respond to a course of one of the antibiotics and require retreatment, more prolonged treatment or treatment with a different antibiotic. Ten to 20 percent of patients who are successfully treated by their first course of antibiotics have a relapse of the colitis after the antibiotics are stopped.Among patients who relapse, additional treatment with antibiotics is less successful than the initial treatment in permanently curing the colitis, and multiple relapses in these patients are common.Among the treatments for multiple relapses ofcolitis, a widely studied and effective treatment is transplantation of fecal bacteria from relatives or stool banks.hospitals,homes,extended care facilities, andnurseries forinfants.bedpans,furniture,toilet seats,linens,telephones,stethoscopes,fingernails,rings (jewelry),floors,infants' rooms, andpails." ,
"Antisocial Personality Disorder" : "A personality disorder (PD) is a persistent pattern of internal experience and behavior that markedly differs from what is considered normal within the person's own culture.Personality disorders are grouped into clusters A, B, and C based on the dominating symptoms.Antisocial personality disorder is a diagnosis that is characterized by an enduring pattern of disregarding and violating the rights of others with symptoms having been present since 15 years of age and may include symptoms like breaking laws, repeated deceitfulness, starting fights, a lack of regard for their own safety or the safety of others, a lack of guilt and taking personal responsibility, a tendency to act impulsively, and irritability.Although not a formal diagnosis, psychopathy is thought to be a more severe form of antisocial personality disorder. Specifically, in order to be considered a psychopath, a person must have a lack of remorse or guilt about their actions in addition to demonstrating antisocial behaviors.Psychopaths tend to be highly suspicious or paranoid, even in comparison to individuals with antisocial personality disorder, which tends to lead the psychopathic person to interpret all aggression toward them as being arbitrary and unfair.Antisocial personality disorder is likely the result of a combination of biologic/genetic and environmental factors.Some theories about the biological risk factors for antisocial personality disorder include the malfunction of certain genes, hormones, or parts of the brain.Diagnoses often associated with antisocial personality disorder include substance-related disorders,(), and reading disorders.Theories regarding the life circumstances that increase the risk for developing antisocial personality disorder include a history of childhood physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; neglect, deprivation, or abandonment; associating with peers who engage in antisocial behavior; or having a parent who is either antisocial or alcoholic.Since there is no specific definitive test that can accurately diagnose antisocial personality disorder, health-care professionals perform a mental-health interview that assesses for the presence of antisocial symptoms. If the cultural context of the symptoms is not considered, antisocial personality disorder is often falsely diagnosed as being present.Research indicates that members of ethnic minorities tend to be wrongly diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, thereby inappropriately resulting in less treatment and more punishment for those individuals.While antisocial personality disorder can be quite resistant to treatment, the most effective interventions tend to be a combination of firm but fairand programming that emphasizes teaching the antisocial personality disorder individuals skills that can be used to live independently and productively within the rules and limits of society.While medications do not directly treat the behaviors that are associated with antisocial personality disorder, they can be useful in addressing conditions like,, and mood swings that often co-occur with this condition.If untreated, people with antisocial personality disorder are at risk for developing or worsening many other mental disorders, as well as for self-mutilation or dying from homicide or.Many people with antisocial personality disorder experience a remission of symptoms by the time they are 50 years old." ,

"Anxiety, Separation (Separation Anxiety)" : "Infants show strangerby crying when someone unfamiliar approaches.Separation anxiety as a normal life stage first develops at about 7 months of age, once object permanence has been established. It is at its strongest at 10-18 months of age and usually subsides by 3 years of age.Separationis a normal stage of development that usually begins in childhood and is characterized by worrying out of proportion to the situation of temporarily leaving home or otherwise separating from loved ones.Approximately 4%-5% of children and adolescents suffer from separation anxiety disorder.Examples of separation anxiety disorder symptoms include school or work refusal or school or work, resistance to going to bed at night, and physical complaints in reaction to actual or anticipated separation from primary caretakers.Professionals trained and experienced in assessingin children will likely interview the afflicted individual and that person's parents or other loved ones separately and ask about symptoms of anxiety, screen for other mental-health conditions, and recommend that the anxiety sufferer receive a full medical evaluation.Separation anxiety disorder is likely caused by the combination of genetic and environmental vulnerabilities. Risk factors include low socioeconomic status, family histories of anxiety, and mothers who were stressed during.A majority of children with separation anxiety disorder have school refusal as a symptom. Up to 80% of children who refuse school qualify for a diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder.Counseling is usually considered the best treatment method compared to medications. Types of counseling used to treat separation anxiety disorder include behavioral, cognitive, and individual psychotherapies, as well as parent counseling and guiding teachers on how to help the person with the disorder.SSRIs like fluvoxamine are considered the safest and most effective medications to treat separation anxiety disorder, followed by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), with benzodiazepines as a last resort.People with separation anxiety disorder are at higher risk for developing other mental-health problems, particularly anxiety disorders.Educating parents on ways to help their child cope with anxiety may be helpful in preventing the development of separation anxiety disorder." ,

"Arsenic Poisoning" : "Arsenic is an element (metalloid) that can combine with organic and inorganic substances.Inorganic arsenic is arsenic alone or combined with inorganic substances that are very toxic to most biologic systems, including humans.Organic arsenic is arsenic combined with organic substances and may be non-toxic or far less toxic to many biologic systems than inorganic arsenic.Symptoms of arsenic poisoning vary with the type andof the poison. Inorganic arsenic may cause abdominal pains, destruction of(hemolysis),, and death quickly. Lower concentrations of inorganic arsenic and organic arsenic cause far less severe symptoms.Diagnosis of arsenic poisoning is made by determining inorganic and organic levels of arsenic in the blood and urine.Treatment of arsenic poisoning in acute toxic poisonings needs to begin quickly; treatment involves removal of arsenic by, chelating agents, replacement of red blood cells, and if ingested, bowel cleansing.Acute toxic inorganic arsenic poisoning has only a fair to poor outcome. Chronic poisoning has a better outcome.Arsenic is found in groundwater, many chemicals, and foods. If arsenic is in the organic form, it is likely nontoxic or weakly toxic to humans, but inorganic arsenic can also be found in similar locations and materials and in high concentrations in industrial processes. In 2013, the FDA made recommendations that less than 10 parts per billion of arsenic was acceptable for levels in apple juice. Levels for arsenic have yet to be FDA approved for rice (still under study), although groundwater levels that provide arsenic to rice are FDA set at less than 10 parts per billion." ,

In some cases, treatment may not be needed.Medicines often are used as the first course of treatment. Treatments used for children and adults are similar.Adults with ITP who have very low platelet counts or problems with bleeding often are treated. Adults who have milder cases of ITP may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts.The acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months. Children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), usually are treated.Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding condition in which the blood doesn't clot as it should. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets.Platelets stick together (clot) to seal smallor breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.There are two types of ITP. Acute ITP is a short-term illness that mainly affects children and often occurs after a viral infection. Most children get well quickly without any treatment. Adults who have ITP most often have chronic (long-lasting) ITP. Symptoms can vary a great deal, and some adults who have mild ITP don't need treatment.In most cases, an autoimmune response is believed to cause ITP. Normally your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known.ITP can't be passed from one person to another.ITP can affect children and adults of all ages. Women are 2 to 3 times more likely than men to get chronic ITP.People who have ITP may have signs of bleeding, such as(purpura) that appear for no reason or tiny red dots (petechiae) that are visible on the skin.Bleeding in ITP also occurs in the form of nosebleeds, bleeding gums, menstrual bleeding that's heavier than usual, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Bleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but it can be life threatening when it occurs.ITP is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and results from blood tests.Treatment for ITP is based on how much and how often you're bleeding and your platelet count. Medicines often are used as the first course of treatment. Treatments used for children and adults are similar.The spleen is sometimes removed if treatment with medicine fails to keep the platelet level high enough to prevent bleeding.You can't prevent ITP, but you can prevent its complications. Talk to your doctor about what medicines are safe for you, protect yourself from injuries that can cause bruising or bleeding, and seek treatment if any signs of infection develop.For most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition.

Symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), distorted perceptions (hypnagogic hallucinations), inability to move or talk (), disturbed nocturnal, and automatic behavior.Narcolepsy usually begins in teenagers or young adults and affects both sexes equally.Abnormalities in the structure and function of a particular group of nerve cells in the brain called hypocretin neurons are thought to play a role in the development of narcolepsy.The diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on a clinical evaluation, specific questionnaires,logs or diaries, and the results of sleep laboratory tests (polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test).Treatment options for narcolepsy include drug and behavioral modification therapies and disease-specific education of the patient and family members. The treatment is individualized, depending on the types and severity of the symptoms, the life conditions of the patients, and the specific goals of therapy.Optimal management usually takes weeks to months to achieve and requires continued communication among the physician, patient, family members, and others.Alerting medications are used for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness. Amphetamines and methylphenidate (Ritalin) are general CNS stimulants that decrease sleepiness and improve alertness. Modafinil (Provigil) and armondafinil (Nuvigil) have alerting effects similar to those of the traditional stimulants but has less undesirable side effects.Anticataplectic medications are used to treat cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are often effective in controlling cataplexy, but also frequently produce side effects that limit their use.Selectivereuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also useful in the treatment of cataplexy and their side effects are milder.

"Gastric Bypass Surgery" : " : This operation is the most common gastric bypass surgery performed in the U.S. First, a small stomach pouch is created by stapling part of the stomach together or by vertical banding. This limits how much food you can eat. Next, a Y-shaped section of the small intestine is attached to the pouch to allow food to bypass the duodenum as well as the first portion of the jejunum. This causes reduced calorie and nutrient absorption. This procedure can now be done with a laparoscope (a thin telescope-like instrument for viewing inside the abdomen) in some people. This involves using small incisions and generally has a more rapid recovery time.: In this more complicated gastric bypass operation, the lower portion of the stomach is removed. The small pouch that remains is connected directly to the final segment of the small intestine, thus completely bypassing both the duodenum and jejunum.

"Gas (Intestinal Gas (Belching, Bloating, Flatulence))" : "The intestine normally contains gas that is rapidly transmitted through the small intestine to the colon. The amount of gas that is normally present is dependent on the effects of colonic bacteria on the undigested food that reaches the colon and the speed with which the gas passes through theand is passed. In normal individuals, most of the lower intestinal gas that is passed (flatus) is gas produced in the colon and is not transmitted from the upper intestines.The definition of excessive gas varies by individual, usually based on what they have considered normal in the past. Some individuals consider excessive gas to be excessive belching or excessive burping (burping a lot), others excessive passing of gas (flatulence), and still others as the sensation of fullness in the abdomen. Although everyone goes through periods of excessive gas, particularly flatulence, it is only when the symptoms become chronic that people become concerned.The most common normal cause of belching is excessive gas in the stomach that comes from swallowed air. However, discomfort in the abdomen for any reason also may lead to excessive belching. Therefore, belching does not always indicate the presence of excessive gas in the stomach. It is not difficult usually to differentiate between excessive gas in the stomach and other causes of excessive gas. If the problem is gas in the stomach, belching brings relief. If it is not gas in the stomach belching does not bring relief. Although excessive belching may be a sign of excessive gas, it usually is not and is rather a sign of abdominal discomfort of many causes or a learned habit of swallowing and immediately regurgitating the air as a belch. Rarely excessive belching (burping a lot) is due to swallowed air during acute psychiatric issues associated with.is the subjective feeling that the abdomen is full than it should be, but does not necessarily mean that the abdomen is enlarged. Distention is the objective enlargement of the abdomen.

The maximum number of farts for a normal person is 20 per day. The number that defines a lot of burping has not been determined.Flatulence results from the production of gas by bacteria within the intestines (usually the colon) when they digest dietary sugars and polysaccharides that reach the colon undigested.Increased gas is not caused by the() or most parasitic or bacterial intestinal infections.

Cramps and severe pain suggest causes other than gas, for example, intestinal obstruction that also can lead to abdominal distention and discomfort.Remedies for truly excessive gas include changes inand suppression of intestinal bacteria that produce the gas. There is no evidence that digestive enzymes, activated charcoal, and simethicone (Gas-X, Mylanta, and others).The remedy for excessive belching not due to excessive gas is by learning new physical habits such aswith the mouth open.Foul smelling gas (flatus) is not synonymous (the same) with excessive gas. The foul smell of flatus results from the types of food that are eaten and the types of gasses produced by the bacteria in the colon, particularly gasses that contain sulfur." ,

"Gastroenteritis (Stomach Flu)" : "The stomach flu (gastroenteritis) is a nonspecific term for various inflammatory problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.Gastroenteritis may be of short duration (acute viral) or for many months (chronic gastroenteritis, such as that caused by food).Signs and symptoms of stomach flu depend on the cause.The most frequent signs and symptoms of viral stomach flu includeSigns and symptoms of bacterial stomach flu includeFood allergies may produce eosinophilic gastroenteritis, a sign of which is increased eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) seen in the blood.Children with the stomach flu or gastroenteritis have similar symptoms to adults, but also may have symptoms such as refusing to drink or being very thirsty.The main way contagious causes of the stomach flu are spread is person to person via the fecal-oral route. Individuals at most risk of catching the stomach flu are those in close association with an infant, child, or an adult that has a viral or bacterial cause of stomach flu .gastroenteritis is spread or transmitted usually by the fecal  oral route or by eating or drinking contaminated foods.causes of gastroenteritis include food, parasites, drugs, toxins, or the side effects of medications.The most common causes of gastroenteritis are infectious, mainly viral (for example,,and many others). The large majority of causes gastroenteritis disease (mainly viral and bacterial) are.Bacterial causes of gastroenteritis include,,,, and others.Stomach flu is diagnosed in most cases without specific tests, however, tests can help define the underlying cause.Home remedies may reduce symptoms of stomach flu, includingchanges.Most people with viral or mild bacterial gastroenteritis require no treatment. Some individuals may require symptom reduction with medications but more seriousmay require antibiotic therapy.Some doctors recommend the  (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast)to people recovering from stomach flu.Notify medical personnel if you have the stomach flu for more than five days, or if, bloodied diarrhea, constant, or high fever develops.The major complication of gastroenteritis is.Stomach flu often can be prevented by hand washing, not eating undercooked food or drinking contaminated water, and avoiding direct contact with individuals with the disease. Some specific types of gastroenteritis can be reduced or prevented by vaccine (for example, vaccine against causing bacteria).or gastroenteritis means any nonspecific inflammatory problem in the gastrointestinal tract; some doctors consider the stomach flu to be more narrowly defined as a viral infection that attacks the digestive system.specifically is caused by eating or drinking contaminated food or fluid that contains bacteria, viruses, parasites and/or their toxins they produce.Food poisoning usually is found in small outbreaks that occur among individuals that have ingested the same foods or drink, and symptoms occur rapidly within hours; whereas the stomach flu has a more gradual onset of symptoms and usually lasts longer than food poisoning.Stomach flu is highly contagious and can be spread quickly to other individuals; whereas food poisoning usually requires ingesting the poison and does not easily spread to other individuals.The viruses that cause the majority of stomach flu (gastroenteritis) are Norovirus spp; whereas the viruses that cause influenza are mainly Influenza A and B viral spp and subtypes.Stomach flu results mainly in problems with the gastrointestinal tract while influenza (flu) involves the respiratory tract. These two problems are not the same thing." ,
"Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)" : "Bird flu (avian flu or avian) refers to strains of influenza that primarily affect wild and domesticated birds. Bird flu is named H or N depending on the proteins found on the surface of the virus.Bird flu symptoms includeSymptoms often progress toAlthough bird flu isand spreads easily among birds, it is uncommon for it to be transmitted to humans.In the late 1990s, a new strain of bird flu arose which was unusually severe (highly pathogenic), resulting in the deaths of hundreds of millions of birds, including poultry.Risk factors for people to contract bird flu include association with birds and poultry farms and bird feces. There have been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.Definitive diagnosis requires identification of the viral strain by immunological tests.Treatment may include antiviral medication and often requires intensive supportive care.Control efforts, including culling infected flocks and vaccinating healthy birds, have limited the spread of highly pathogenic bird flu strains.In 2011, a mutated strain of highly pathogenic bird flu appeared, H5N1, which is concerning because the existing poultry vaccines are not very effective against the H5N1 strain. In 2013, a new strain, H7N9, appeared in China; other strains are rare.Human infection with highly infectious strains of bird flu is uncommon, with most infections occurring after exposure to infected birds or their droppings.There is no commercially available vaccine for humans against bird flu strains. Human infection with H5N1 bird flu is fatal in approximately 55% of infected humans and 37% infected with H7N9, but only a relatively small number of humans worldwide have become infected since 1997 (H5N1 = 784 people infected and H7N9 = 622).The prognosis of bird flu is fair to poor because of frequent complications and high death rates." ,

"Genetic Brain Lesions (Brain Lesions (Lesions on the Brain))" : "The brain is perhaps the most important organ in the body, responsible for the unconscious autonomic activities like,and temperature control, sensation, movement, and thought process.Neurons and glia are the two types of cells that make up the brain,Each area of the brain has a responsibility for brain function.A brain lesion describes an area of damaged brain. It may be isolated or there may be numerous areas affected.Symptoms of a brain lesion depend upon what part of the brain is affected and may be minimal or life-threatening.Diagnosis of brain lesions begin with a careful history and physical examination of the affected individual. The brain may be imaged in a variety of ways including CT,and.Treatment and prognosis of brain lesions depend upon the underlying illness or injury, and the amount of damage sustained by the brain.Neurons are the cells that process and transmit information in the brain. Each cell has two connectors, the axon and dendrite. The axon of one neuron connects with the dendrite of another at junction or synapse. Special chemicals called neurotransmitters help transfer the electrical impulse across the synapse so that one neuron can excite another.Glial cells are located between neurons and help support their activity.Microglial cells are part of the immune system within brain tissue helping clear dead cells and other debris.Astrocytes help clear neurotransmitter chemicals so that the synapse can be ready to react to the next signal that might arrive.Oligodendrocytes produce and maintain the myelin sheath that coats and insulates the axon making electrical conduction more efficient.Ependymal cells produce CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) which is located within the ventricles of the brain and in the subarachnoid space that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Aside from allowing the brain to float in the skull, CSF acts as a cushion againstand also helps wash away some of the metabolic waster protects that are produced with brain function." ,

The active trophozoite attaches to the lining of the small intestine with a sucker and is responsible for causing the signs and symptoms of giardiasis.The trophozoite cannot live long outside of the body, therefore it cannot spread the infection to others. The inactive cyst, on the other hand, can exist for prolonged periods outside the body.When it is ingested, stomach acid activates the cyst, and the cyst develops into the disease-causing trophozoite. It takes ingestion of only ten cysts to cause infection. Trophozoites are important not only because they cause the symptoms of giardiasis, but also because they produce the cysts that exit the body in the feces and spread the infection to others.Cysts of Giardia are present in the feces of infected persons. Thus, the infection is spread from person to person by contamination of food with feces, or by direct fecal-oral contamination. Cysts also survive in water, for example in fresh water lakes and streams. As a result, giardiasis is the most common cause of water-borne, parasitic illness in the U.S.Domestic mammals (for example,, cats, calves) and wild mammals (for example, beavers) can become infected with Giardia; however, it is not clear how often domestic or wild mammals transmit giardiasis to humans.Giardiasis also has occurred as outbreaks from recreational water sources such aspools, water parks, and hot tubs, most likely because of an infected user rather than a source of water that was contaminated." ,

Domestic violence is most effectively assessed when the professional asks questions that call for more than a yes or no answer and do not directly inquire about domestic abuse, at least earlier during any assessment interview.Domestic abuse is treated by establishing and maintaining the safety of the victim, providing appropriate legal consequences to the batterer, addressing the emotional impact on the victim and the problems of the abuser, particularly if one of the problems includes alcohol or other substance abuse.The prognosis of domestic violence can be quite negative if it goes on untreated, in that the emotional and physical consequences of continued abuse can be severe and even end in homicide. Treatment and enhancing social supports to the victim can improve prognosis.Prevention of domestic violence involves providing economic opportunity, mentors, role models, organized community programs for youth and families, a school environment that promotes prevention of abusiveness in any relationship, and adult family members who are nurturing and who provide consistent, structured support." ,

"Fibrocystic Disease of the Pancreas (Cystic Fibrosis)" : "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is anthat affects the secretory glands, including the mucus and sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis mostly affects the, pancreas,,, sinuses, and sex organs.CF is due to a mutation in the CF gene on chromosome 7. The CF gene encodes a protein known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The abnormal CFTR protein in patients with CF leads to disruption of chloride channels on the cells.CF is characterized by the production of abnormal mucus that is excessively thick and sticky. The abnormal mucus leads to blockages within the lungs and airways. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections that can damage the lungs.Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have cystic fibrosis. Over time, permanent damage to the lungs can cause severeproblems.The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in the pancreas. As a result, the digestive enzymes from the pancreas can't reach the small intestine, causing impaired absorption ofand proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition.Due to the defect in chloride channels, CF fibrosis also causes the sweat to become very salty.Every person inherits two CFTR genes -- one from each parent. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; children who inherit a faulty gene from each parent will have cystic fibrosis.Children who inherit one faulty gene and one normal gene will be CF carriers. Cystic fibrosis carriers usually have no symptoms of cystic fibrosis, but they can pass the faulty gene on to their children.About 30,000 people in the United States have cystic fibrosis. It is one of the most common inherited diseases among Caucasians. About 1,000 new cases of cystic fibrosis are diagnosed each year.The symptoms of cystic fibrosis vary from person to person and over time.Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis based on the results from various tests. The most commonly used test is a, which measures theof chloride in sweat. Direct genetic testing to identify the CF mutation is also used. Most U.S. States screen newborns for cystic fibrosis.Cystic fibrosis has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. Treatment may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines,, and more. Early treatment for cystic fibrosis can improve both quality of life and lifespan.As treatments for cystic fibrosis continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease.

"Folling Disease (Phenylketonuria)" : "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disease that's inherited that increases the levels of phenylalanine in the blood. If left untreated, high phenylalanine levels can cause intellectual disability and other problems. Phenylketonuria disease was discovered in 1934 by Dr. A. Folling.Signs and symptoms of PKU vary from mild to severe depending upon phenylalanine levels. Infants appear normal until a few months old when they start to showChildren with untreated PKU also may have lighter skin and hair than other family members, and also may develop a musty or mouse-like odor due to excess phenylalanine. These are classic PKU symptoms.Less severe forms of PKU (sometimes termed variant PKU and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia may develop less severe symptoms with a smaller risk of.Women with PKU that have uncontrolled phenylalanine levels can havethat are at significant risk for intellectual disability, low birth weight, heart defects,, behavior problems, and slow growth.PKU occurs in about 1/10,000 to15,000 births, but classic PKU symptoms are rarely seen because of newborn screening tests for the disease.Mutations in the PAH gene cause phenylketonuria. Some mutations in this gene allow the enzyme to retain some activity resulting in variant PKU and/or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia.PKU is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern so that both copies of the gene in the cell have mutations. Consequently, the autosomal recessive condition in both parents carry one copy of the mutated gene and parents typically do not show symptoms. Symptoms of PKU develop in their children when both parents donate one autosomal recessive condition to the newborn.PKU has many different names, for example, phenylketonuria, PKU, Folling Disease, Folling's Disease, and phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency disease.PKU does not shorten a person's life expectancy, with or without treatment.Blood tests for PKU is required for infants (newborns) in all 50 states.There is a 1 in 4 chance of having a PKU infant when both parents are genetic carriers. The approximate incident rate of PKU in the US is 0.01%. This means about 74 infants every day are diagnosed with PKU.PKU patients usually are treated in a special metabolic disease clinic with restrictions on foods that contain phenylalanine and are given amino acids,, minerals, and other micronutrients along with close monitoring of phenylalanine levels.A PKUbans meat, fish, chicken, eggs, nuts, beans, milk, and other dairy products. People with PKU also need to avoid, a type of peptide composed of aspartic acid and phenylalanine." ,

"Foot, Broken (Broken Foot)" : "The bones in the foot may be broken in many ways including direct blows, crush injuries, falls and overuse or stress.Signs and symptoms of a broken foot may include pain, limping, swelling, bruising, and refusal to bear weight on the affected foot.Initial treatment may include RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation). Rest may include the use of crutches to limit weight bearing.X-rays often help make the diagnosis butor(CT scan) may be needed to help visualize the injury.Treatment of foot fractures depend upon which bone is broken but many fractures are treated with a compression dressing, a stiff- soled shoe, boot, and weight bearing as tolerated.Some foot fractures require surgery to repair the damage.Complications of foot fractures include non-union at the fracture site,if a joint is involved, and infection if the skin is broken.Healing and recovery time for a broken foot depends upon the type of fracture and the bone(s) involved.The hindfoot consists of the talus that forms the base of the ankle joint where it meets the tibia (shin bone) and the calcaneous or heel bone.Ligaments from both the talus and the heel bone span the ankle joint and attach to the tibia and fibula (the other shin bone) to provide stability.The midfoot consists of the navicular, the cuboid, and the three cuneiform bones. The midfoot is where inversion and supination of the foot occurs. These motions allow the sole of the foot to turn inwards and upwards.The fiveare connected to each toe.The toe bones are called phalanges (single = phalanx) with the great toe having two and the other four toes having three each. These bones are named based upon their relationship to the body: proximal, middle and distal. Proximal means closest to the center of the body while distal is furthest from the center. The toenails are located over the digital phalanges.The arch of the foot is maintained by the plantar fascia, a thick fibrous band of tissue that runs from the calcaneus to the metatarsal, preventing the bones of the foot from flattening.There are places in the foot where two bones meet to form a joint. Each joint has its own set of structures that help maintain stability.Injuries to the foot include fractures of the bone,of the ligaments that stabilize the joints, andof the muscles and tendons that move the foot. Joints can also become inflamed (arthritis). Arthritis can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).Foot fractures account for 10% of all the broken bones in the body, and the mechanism of injury usually can give a clue as to what bone might be injured.Fractures of the calcaneus (heel bone) usually occur when a person jumps or falls from a height, landing directly on their. The force of the landing may also be transmitted up the body to cause fractures of the ankle, knee, hip, and lumbar spine.Injuries to the midfoot, the, and phalanges often are caused by a direct blow sustained when a kick goes awry or from a crush injury when a heavy object is dropped on the foot.Twisting injuries can cause bones to break. For example, fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal occur when the ankle rolls inward and a fragment of the bone is pulled off (avulsed) by the peroneus tendon.The most common causes of foot injuries include falls; crush injuries (including impacts from a heavy object or an automobile accident) missed steps, and stress/overuse injuries." ,

"Functional Dyspepsia (Dyspepsia)" : "Indigestion (dyspepsia) is a functional disease in which the gastrointestinal (GI) organs, primarily the stomach and first part of the small intestine (and occasionally the), function abnormally. It is a chronic disease in which the symptoms fluctuate in frequency and intensity usually over many months or years. It may occur every day or intermittently for days or weeks at a time followed by days or weeks of relief (a pattern referred to as periodicity).Theories of the cause of indigestion include abnormal input from intestinal sensory nerves, abnormal processing of input from the sensory nerves, and abnormal stimulation of theby motor nerves.The primary symptoms of indigestion areThe symptoms most often are provoked by eating.Indigestion frequently occurs, though the majority of the time it is actually caused by.Indigestion is diagnosed on the basis of typical symptoms and the absence of other GI diseases, particularly acid-related diseases (,,, and ulcers), and non-gastrointestinal diseases that might give rise to the symptoms.Since the heart sits near the stomach, there often is confusion about what is causing lower chest or upper. Therefore, indigestion should be considered in anyone with lower, andshould be considered in anyone with upper abdominal pain. Occasionally, the discomfort of indigestion can be felt in the back.Testing in indigestion is directed primarily at excluding the presence of other GI diseases and non-GI diseases. Some patients may require specific testing of certain GI functions.It is important to exclude other causes for the indigestion since their treatment will be different than that for indigestion without a clear cause.Treatment in indigestion for which there is no other cause found, is primarily with education as well as smooth muscle relaxant and promotility drugs. There also may be a role for anti-depressant drugs and dietary changes.Because acid reflux is so common, a trial of potent stomach acid suppression often is used as the initial treatment.Many people are able to identify specific foods that provoke their indigestion. Despite this fact, there are few foods whose avoidance can be universally recommended since not all people with indigestion have trouble with the same foods. There also are no foods or diets that can be recommended for preventing indigestion other than those that eliminated foods that provoke symptoms.There is no evidence that home remedies or natural remedies prevent indigestion.Future advances in the treatment of indigestion depend on a clearer understanding of its many cause(s)." ,

"Functional Hemispherectomy (Surgical Options for Epilepsy)" : "Surgery to remove the area of the brain producing seizures.Surgery to interrupt the nerve pathways through whichimpulses spread within the brain.The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections, called lobes -- the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in which the seizure focus is located within the temporal lobe, is the most common type of epilepsy inand adults. In a, brain tissue in the temporal lobe is resected, or cut away, to remove the seizure focus. The anterior (front) and mesial (deep middle) portions of the temporal lobe are the areas most often involved. Extratemporal resection involves removing brain tissue from areas outside of the temporal lobe.This is surgery to remove isolated-- areas of injury or defect such as aor malformed blood vessel -- that are responsible for seizure activity. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed.The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the two halves (hemispheres) of the brain. A corpus callosotomy is an operation in which all or part of this structure is cut, disabling communication between the hemispheres and preventing the spread of seizures from one side of the brain to the other. This procedure, sometimes called split-brain surgery, is for patients with extreme forms of uncontrollable epilepsy who have intense seizures that can lead to violent falls and potentially serious injury.This is a variation of a hemispherectomy, a radical procedure in which one entire hemisphere, or one half of the brain, is removed. With a functional hemispherectomy, one hemisphere is disconnected from the rest of the brain, but only a limited area of brain tissue is removed. This surgery generally is limited to children younger than 13 years old who have one hemisphere that is not functioning normally.This procedure is used to help control seizures that begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow(transections) in the brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the movement of seizure impulses but do not disturb normal brain activity, leaving the person's abilities intact." ,
"Functional Heart Murmur (Heart Murmur)" : "Turbulent blood flow within the heart causes abnormal sounds called murmurs.Most murmurs are functional, or physiologic, and are normal variants.

Once the brain cells are injured, they lose their ability to communicate with other cells, leading to dysfunction.Signs and symptoms of dementia are varied, but typically include memory loss, problems with speaking or communicating (word-finding difficulties, repetition), problems focusing, impairments in judgment, struggles with completing tasks, or even difficulty comprehending what is seen.The types of dementia include, vascular dementa, and. Other types include dementia associated withor. Senile dementia () is a term that was once used to describe all dementias; this term is no longer used as a diagnosis.The stages of dementia are used when a progressive dementia has been diagnosed. The stages include:Dementia is diagnosed after a series of assessments, including a physical evaluation and determination of the history of any problems. Memory tests, imaging studies, and blood work may exclude other problems which might mimic dementia. The diagnosis of dementia can take a long time.The treatment for dementia is primarily supportive. Prescription medications cannot reverse or stop the process. Environmental changes, a structured schedule, regular, and staying engaged with others can all be beneficial.Home care for dementia can be beneficial for patients and families, as a way for patients to remain close to family members. However, caregivers should confirm that they have help to avoid burnout.Prescription drugs to treat dementia include donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), galantamine (Razadyne), and memantine (Namenda). A new combination of donepezil and memantine (Namzaric) was recently approved by the FDA.Although there is no way to absolutely prevent dementia, modifying the risk factors of,, alcohol intake, and keepingas well-controlled as possible, as well as exercising regularly can help.The prognosis for a person with dementia is individual. Some patients have a rapidly progressive course, while others progress very slowly. Factors which contribute to the progression of dementia haven't been fully identified." ,

"Foul Breath (Bad Breath)" : "Bad breath, or halitosis, is characterized by an unpleasant odor of the mouth.Causes of bad breath include food, tobacco products, poor, health problems,, oral infections, dental problems, or medications.Symptoms of bad breath include unpleasant odor or taste in the mouth,, or white coating on the tongue.Treatments for bad breath include proper dental hygiene, mouthwash,-free gum, quitting, and changing bad habits.Bad breath can usually be prevented by proper, quitting, and avoiding foods that cause bad breath odors.: Food is a primary source of bad odors that come from the mouth. Some foods, such as garlic, onions, spicy foods, exotic spices (such as curry), some cheeses, fish, and acidicsuch as coffee can leave a lingering smell. Most of the time the odor is short lived. Other foods may get stuck in the, promoting the growth of bacteria and dental plaques, which causes bad breath odor. Low carbohydrate diets may also cause ketone breath. These diets cause the body to burn fat as its energy source. The end-product of making this energy is ketones, which cause a fruity acetone-like odor on the breath when exhaled. This fruity odor in a diabetic might indicate uncontrolled blood sugars.:andcan leave chemicals that remain in the mouth. Smoking can also precipitate other bad-breath causes such asor.: When a person does not brush or floss his/her teeth regularly, food particles remaining in the mouth can rot and cause bad odors. Poor dental care can lead to a buildup of plaque in the mouth, which causes an odor of its own. Plaque buildup on the teeth can also lead to an unhealthy condition called periodontal (gum) disease. When plaque hardens, it is referred to as tartar (calculus). Tartar holds bacteria that can irritate the gums and lead to gum disease. The mild form of gum disease is called; if gingivitis is not treated, it can advance to periodontitis.:,,() and other throat infections, the,(flu),(tonsilloliths),,, postnasal drip,,(or),, other stomach orproblems, and somediseases or kidney diseases may be associated with bad breath.Also called, dry mouth can also cause bad breath. Saliva helps moisten and cleanse the mouth, and when the body does not product enough saliva, bad breath may result. Dry mouth may be caused by salivary gland problems, connective tissue disorders (Sjgren's syndrome), medications, orthrough the mouth.: Many medications used to treatcan cause dry mouth, another cause of halitosis.

"Deep Vein Thrombosis" : "There are both superficial and deep veins in the limbs or extremities (arms and legs). Ain the deep veins is a concern because it can cause life-threatening complications.A(thrombus) in the deep venous system of the leg becomes dangerous if a piece of the blood clot breaks off or travels through the blood stream, through the heart, and into the pulmonary arteries forming a. A person may not have signs or symptoms of a small(blood clot in the), but a large embolism can be fatal.Risk factors for blood clot formation include immobility, a genetic tendency toward blood clotting, and injury to veins or adjacent tissues occurs.Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include:The diagnosis ofcan be suggested by blood tests and confirmed byor other imaging tests.Treatment oftypically involves blood thinning medications (anticoagulants) unless they cannot be used in a patient (contraindicated). In that situation, an inferior vena cava filter is potentially considered.Complications ofincludepulmonary embolism (PE) and post-phlebitic syndrome.There are other types of thrombosis such as:Arteries have thin muscles within their walls to be able to withstand the pressure of the heart pumping blood to the far reaches of the body. Veins don't have a significant muscle lining, and there is nothing pumping blood back to the heart except physiology. Blood returns to the heart because the body's large muscles squeeze the veins as they contract in their normal activity of moving the body. The normal activities of moving the body returns the blood back to the heart. Being mobile causes this blood return system to fail, and the resulting stagnated blood may clot.There are two types of veins in the arm or leg; superficial veins and deep veins. Superficial veins lie just below the skin and are easily seen on the surface. Deep veins, as their name implies, are located deep within the muscles of the extremity. Blood flows from the superficial veins into the deep venous system through small perforator veins. Superficial and perforator veins have one-way valves within them that allow blood to flow only in the direction of the heart when the veins are squeezed.A blood clot (thrombus) in the deep venous system of the leg or arm, in itself, is not dangerous. It becomes potentially life-threatening when a piece of the blood clot breaks off  and embolizes, travels through the circulation system through the heart, and enters into one of the pulmonary arteries and becomes lodged. This can prevent blood from flowing properly through the lung and decreasing the amount of oxygen absorbed and distributed back to the body.Diagnosis and treatment of a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is meant to preventpulmonary embolism.in the superficial veins do not pose a danger of causing pulmonary emboli because the perforator vein valves act as a sieve to prevent clots from entering the deep venous system. They are usually not at risk of causing pulmonary embolism." ,

Specific causes include physical obstruction of the pharynx or esophagus, diseases of the brain, diseases of the smooth muscle of the esophagus, diseases of skeletal muscle of the pharynx, and miscellaneous diseases.Symptoms of dysphagia may be swallowing-related or non-swallowing-related.The differential diagnosis of dysphagia includes odynophagia and globus sensation, tracheo-esophageal fistula, rumination syndrome,(), and.Evaluation and diagnosis of the cause of dysphagia includes history, physical examination,, X-rays,, esophageal impedence, esophageal acid testing, and tests for the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy and metabolic myopathies.The treatment of dysphagia depends primarily on its cause.Newer diagnostic procedures for the evaluation and diagnosis of the cause of dysphagia include high resolution or 3D manometry and endoscopic.Food is first chewed well in the mouth and mixed with saliva.The tongue then propels the chewed food into the throat (pharynx).The soft palate elevates to prevent the food from entering the posterior end of the nasal passages, and the upper pharynx contracts, pushing the food (referred to as a bolus) into the lower pharynx. At the same time, the voice box (larynx) is pulled upwards by muscles in the neck, and, as a result, thebends downwards. This dual action closes off the opening to the larynx and windpipe (trachea) and prevents passing food from entering the larynx and trachea.The contraction of the muscular pharynx continues as a progressing, circumferential wave into the lower pharynx pushing the food along.A ring of muscle that encircles the upper end of the esophagus, known as the upper esophageal sphincter, relaxes, allowing the wave of contraction to push the food from the lower pharynx on into the esophagus. (When there is no swallow effort, the muscle of the upper sphincter is continuously contracted, closing off the esophagus from the pharynx and preventing anything within the esophagus from regurgitating back up into the pharynx.)The wave of contraction, referred to as a peristaltic wave, progresses from the pharynx down the entire length of the esophagus.Shortly after the bolus enters the upper esophagus, a specialized ring of muscle encircling the lower end of the esophagus where it meets the stomach, known as the lower esophageal sphincter, relaxes so that when the bolus arrives it can pass on into the stomach. (When there is no swallow the muscle of the lower sphincter is continuously contracted, closing off the esophagus from the stomach and preventing contents of the stomach from regurgitating back up into the esophagus.)After the bolus passes, the lower sphincter tightens again to prevent contents of the stomach from regurgitating back up into the esophagus. It remains tight until the next bolus comes along.the conscious initiation of swallowing,propulsion of food into the pharynx,closing of the nasal passages or larynx,opening of the upper or lower esophageal sphincters,physical blockage to the passage of food, andtransit of the bolus by peristalsis through the body of the esophagus." ,

These tumors have high recurrence rates but a very low chance of progression to higher stages.High-grade T1 tumors have high chances of recurrence and progression and may need additional treatment in the form of BCG or chemotherapy instillation in the bladder. Patients unresponsive to these may be best treated by radical cystectomy (bladder removal).Radical cystectomy provides the best chances of cure in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.Systemic, usually intravenous chemotherapy is used in patients with metastatic disease at presentation or those in which bladder cancer cells are present outside the bladder wall or induring radical cystectomy.The prognosis of bladder cancer ranges from good to poor and depends on the stage and grade of the cancer.People may reduce the risk of bladder cancer by notand by avoiding environmental carcinogens.Informational and support groups are available for anyone concerned about bladder cancer." ,

A person cannot will it away. Untreated or undertreated, it can worsen or return.There are many safe and effective medications, particularly the SSRI antidepressants, that can be of great help in the treatment of depression.For full recovery from a mood disorder, regardless of whether there is a precipitating factor or it seems to come out of the blue, treatments with medications, phototherapy and/or() or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as well asand participation in support groups are often necessary.In the future, through depression research and education, we will continue to improve our treatments, decrease society's burden, and hopefully improve prevention of this illness." ,

Until validated criteria are available, it seems reasonable to do screening endoscopies in GERD patients who cannot be taken off acid suppression therapy after two to three years.The diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus rests upon seeing (at) a pink esophageal lining that extends a short distance (usually less than 2.5 inches) up the esophagus from the gastroesophageal junction and finding intestinal type cells (goblet cells) on biopsy of the lining.There is a small but definite increased risk of() in patients with Barrett's esophagus.If the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is uncertain, a second opinion should be obtained because this diagnosis may generate greater costs than GERD alone as well as problems with obtaining life, health, and disability insurance. Therefore, it is critical to make an accurate diagnosis.The treatment for Barrett's esophagus is, in general, essentially the same as for GERD. Treatment of GERD either medical (acid-suppressing drugs) or surgical (), does not result in the disappearance of Barrett's esophagus or in a reducedrisk.Dysplasia is a cellular process that occurs in the Barrett's lining and indicates a heightened risk of. Therefore, periodic endoscopic biopsies, of the Barrett's mucosa are performed to look for dysplasia.The recommended frequency for initial endoscopic biopsy surveillance in Barrett's without dysplasia is twice annually. If no dysplasia is found, surveillance then is performed every three years.If low grade dysplasia is present, endoscopic biopsy surveillance should be done every six months indefinitely.The management of high grade dysplasia involves repeating the biopsies soon after the high grade dysplasia is discovered to exclude an accompanying cancer. Esophagectomy (surgical removal of the esophagus) is the gold standard of therapy for high grade dysplasia and cancer, but experimental procedures are available.Ablation (removal by destruction) and other experimental techniques look promising, but long term (5-year) data to prove their durability and impact on the natural history of Barrett's, dysplasia, and early cancer are awaited." ,

"Achondroplasia" : "Achondroplasia is aof bone growth.Achondroplasia is the cause of the most common type of dwarfism (short-limbed disproportionate dwarfism)Achondroplasia is the most common cause of short stature with disproportionately short limbs.The appearance of the person with achondroplasia is characteristic.Intelligence is normal in people with achondroplasia.Complications of achondroplasia can affect the brain and the spinal cord.Achondroplasia is inherited as a dominant trait but 80% of cases are due to new mutations (neither parent has achondroplasia).Achondroplasia can be diagnosed before birth.The baby with achondroplasia has a relatively long, narrow torso (trunk) with short extremities (arms and legs) and a disproportionate shortening of the proximal (near the torso) segments of the limbs (the upper arms and thighs).There is a typically large head with prominence of the forehead (frontal bossing), underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the midface with cheekbones that lack prominence, and a low nasalwith narrow nasal passages.The baby's fingers appear short and the ring and middle fingers may diverge, giving the hand a trident (three-pronged) appearance. Most joints can extend more than normal. For example, the knees can hyperextend beyond the normal stopping point. Not all joints are lax in this way. To the contrary, extension and rotation of the elbow are abnormally limited. Hip extension also tends to be limited.At birth there is often prominence of the mid-to-lower back with a small gibbus (a hump). With, the hump goes away and a pronounced sway (lordosis) of theregion (the lower back) becomes apparent. The lumbar lordosis is persistent into adulthood.  The legs are bowed (genu varum).The baby exhibits some decrease in muscle tone (hypotonia). Because of the large head, especially compared to rest of the body, and the decreased muscle tone, the child with achondroplasia will run behind schedule in reaching the usual motor developmental milestones. The schedule to which an achondroplastic child's development should be compared is not that for all children in the general population, but rather the growth charts and timetable followed by children with achondroplasia.Intelligence is generally normal in patients with achondroplasia. Enlargement of the brain (megalencephaly) is common and normal with achondroplasia." ,
"Achilles Tendon Rupture" : "The most common initial symptom of Achilles tendon rupture is a sudden snap at the back of the heels with intense. Immediately after the rupture, the majority of individuals will have difficult.Some individuals may have had previous complains of calf or, suggesting prior tendon inflammation or irritation.Immediately after an Achilles tendon rupture, most individuals will develop a limp. In addition, when the ankle is moved, the patient will complain of. In all cases, the affected ankle will have no strength.Once the Achilles tendon is ruptured, the individual will not be able to run, climb up the stairs, or stand on his toes. The ruptured Achilles tendon prevents the power from the calf muscles to move the heel.Whenever the diagnosis is missed, the recovery is often prolonged.Bruising and swelling around the calf and ankle occur.Achilles tendon rupture is frequent in elderly individuals who have a sedentary lifestyle and suddenly become active. In these individuals, the tendon is not strong and the muscles are deconditioned, making recovery more difficult.Achilles tendon rupture has been reported after injection of corticosteroids around the heel bone or attachment of the tendon. The fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin [Cipro]) is also known to cause Achilles tendon weakness and rupture, especially in young children.Some individuals have had a prior tendon rupture that was managed conservatively. In such cases, recurrence of rupture is very high." ,

"Acid Reflux during Pregnancy (Heartburn and Pregnancy)" : "is a condition in which acid backs up (refluxes) from the stomach into theand sometimes up to the throat, irritating the tissues.Heartburn duringcan be overwhelming. To some women it seems a constant problem.Heartburn during pregnancy can be a symptom of(, or).Heartburn during pregnancy feels the same as heartburn when you are not- a burningin the upper abdomen or chest area.Heartburn during pregnancy is a common symptom due to high levels ofand progesterones during pregnancy causing the lower esophageal sphincter (the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus that normally prevents acid from refluxing) to weaken. This weakness resolves after delivery. In addition the growing uterus can also put pressure on the stomach and push acid into the esophagus.Foods that can cause heartburn during pregnancy include chocolate, peppermint, caffeinated beverages (such as coffee, tea, and soft drinks), fatty foods, and alcohol.Heartburn during pregnancy can usually be managed with changes in, lifestyle, and habits.If lifestyle changes do not resolve the heartburn during pregnancy, a doctor may recommend antacids, but these should be used only under a doctor's supervision. Antacids may reduce the absorption of iron in the, and magnesium-containing antacids could slow labor. Consult your doctor before taking any medications, even over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, while you are pregnant.Tums are considered safe to take during pregnancy for heartburn relief. Tums also contains calcium, which pregnant women need. Take it at a different time than any iron supplements you take.Other over-the-counter (OTC) medications including antacids (Rolaids, etc.), H2 blockers such as ranitidine (Zantac) or cimetidine (Tagamet), or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can also be taken during pregnancy.Because heartburn during pregnancy is thought to be caused by pregnancy hormones, heartburn will usually go away after delivery and no further treatment is needed.Fun fact: there is an old wives' tale that heartburn during pregnancy means your baby will have a full head of hair. This is actually true! The heartburn itself doesnt cause the hair growth, rather, estrogen levels during pregnancy cause the esophageal sphincter to relax, which allows stomach acid to back up into the esophagus, resulting in heartburn. The estrogen plays a role in hair growth in the developing baby." ,

"Acute Hepatitis B (Hepatitis B)" : "Thevirus is a DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family of.B virus is not related to thevirus or thevirus.Some people withB never clear the virus and are chronically infected. Approximately 2 billion individuals in the world have evidence of past or present hepatitis B, and 2.2 million people in the U.S. are chronically infected with hepatitis B. Many of these people appear healthy but can spread the virus to others.Hepatitis B infection is transmitted through sexual contact, contact with contaminated blood (for example, through shared needles used for illicit, intravenous drugs), and from mother to child. Hepatitis B is not spread through food, water, or casual contact.Serologic (blood) markers specifically for hepatitis B virus are used to diagnose hepatitis B viral infection. The blood tests can also identify the stage of the infection (past or present) and people who are at highest risk for complications.Injury to theby hepatitis B virus is caused by the body's immune response as the body attempts to eliminate the virus.In the United States, 95% of adults who get hepatitis B are able to clear the virus and cure themselves of infection. The remaining 5% of adults with acute hepatitis B go on to develop chronic hepatitis B. Those who acquire the infection in childhood are much more likely to have chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B may lead toor liver failure. Approximately 15% to 25% of people with chronic infection will die prematurely as a result of the infection.Progression of chronic hepatitis B viral infection occurs insidiously (subtly and gradually), usually over several decades. The course is determined primarily by the age at which the hepatitis B viral infection is acquired and the interaction between the virus and the body's immune system.Treatment with current antiviral drugs suppresses viral reproduction in about 40% to 90% of patients with chronic hepatitis B. The medications are also effective in reducing inflammation and improving blood tests. This can delay or reduce complications such as cirrhosis. However, only about 50% of people achieve a sustained viral suppression, and relapse is common. The medications do not cure the infection.Liver transplantation should be considered for patients with impending liver failure due to acute (initial) infection or advanced cirrhosis.Hepatitis B is preventable through vaccination. All children should receive the vaccine. In addition, adults at high risk for hepatitis B should be vaccinated. Unvaccinated people who are exposed to hepatitis B should be evaluated by a physician to determine if they need specific immune globulin (HBIG)." ,
"Acute Lung Injury (ARDS)" : "ARDS, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a lung condition that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood. ARDS can be life threatening. This is because your body's organs, such as the kidneys and brain, need oxygen-rich blood to work properly.Most people who develop ARDS are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe. If you have trouble, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 911.In ARDS, infections, injuries, or other conditions cause the lung's tiny blood vessels to leak more fluid than normal into the' air sacs. This prevents the lungs from filling with air and moving enough oxygen into the bloodstream.Some common conditions and factors that can lead to ARDS are,, severe bleeding caused by an injury, an injury to the chest or head, breathing in harmful fumes or smoke, and inhaling vomited stomach contents from the mouth.People at risk for ARDS have a condition or illness that can directly or indirectly injure their lungs.The first signs and symptoms of ARDS are feeling like you can't get enough air into your lungs, rapid breathing, and low oxygen levels in the blood. Other signs and symptoms depend on the cause of the condition. They may occur before ARDS develops.Your doctor will diagnose ARDS based on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results from tests.ARDS is treated with oxygen therapy, fluids, and medicines. Treatments are done in a hospital's intensive care unit. Patients who have ARDS may develop other medical problems while in the hospital. The most common problems are infections,(collapsed lung), lung scarring, and.Some people fully recover from ARDS. Others continue to have health problems. These problems may include shortness of breath,and muscle weakness,, and problems with memory and thinking clearly.You can take steps to recover from ARDS and improve your quality of life. Ask your family and friends to help with everyday activities. Don't smoke and avoidand other lung irritants, such as harmful fumes. Go to pulmonary rehabilitation if you doctor recommends it. Join a support group for ARDS. Seek help from your health care team if you feel depressed.ARDS treatment has improved in recent years. As a result, more people are surviving ARDS.

"Addiction, Sexual (Sexual Addiction)" : "Sexualis a condition that involves the sufferer becoming excessively preoccupied with thoughts or behaviors that give a desired sexual effect.More than 30 million people are thought to suffer from a sexual addiction in the United States alone.Paraphilias are disorders that involve the sufferer becoming sexually aroused by objects or actions that are considered less conventional and/or less easily accessible to the sex addict.Sexual addictions may be either paraphilic or nonparaphilic. Nonparaphilic addictions are classified by the() as sexual disorder, not otherwise specified.No one factor is thought to cause sexual addiction, but there are thought to be biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to the development of these disorders.Sex addicts have been described as suffering from a negative pattern of sexual behavior that leads to significant problems or distress.As is true with virtually any other mental-health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has a sexual addiction. Therefore, health-care practitioners diagnose these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental-health information to distinguish sexual addiction from medical and other mental-health disorders.Many people with a sexual addiction benefit from the support and structure of recovery groups or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). When sexual compulsions become severe, the sufferer may require inpatient treatment or participation in an intensive outpatient treatment program.Seroetoninergic (SSRI) antidepressants, antiseizure medications, naltrexone, and medications that decrease male hormones have been found to decrease the compulsive urges and/or impulses associated with sexual addictions for some sufferers.The prognosis of sexual addictions depends on a number of factors.of sexual addiction may involve interventions that enhance self-esteem and self-image, addressing emotional problems, educating children about the dangers of excessive internet use, monitoring and limiting computer use, and screening out pornographic sites.Sex addiction is associated with a number of potential medical, occupational, legal, social, and emotional complications.Research on sexual addiction includes exploring potential risk factors and developing accurate screening and assessment tools for these disorders." ,
"Ad14 (Killer Cold Virus (Adenovirus Infection, Ad14))" : "14 (Ad14) is termed the killervirus because of the high incidence of hospitalizations and deaths attributed to the viral strain.Ad14are passed person to person or picked up from items touched by infected people and then initially invade cells in the eye, nose, or mouth that subsequently allow further spread to other body organs.Symptoms and signs resemble those of a cold (, runny nose, mild) for about three to five days; the majority of people clear the disease, but up to about 40% may need hospitalization with severe symptoms of pneumonia, and shortness of breath; other organ related symptoms may develop such as eye, bladder, and GI problems.Ad 14 isand is transmitted person to person and by touching contaminated surfaces.The incubation period averages about five to eight days, but the contagious period can last for weeks to months.Risk factors include crowded living conditions, contact with an infected individual, and immunosuppression.Ad14 is presumptively diagnosed by history, physical exam, X-ray, and in association with other Ad14-diagnosed patients in the community; definitive diagnosis is completed with isolation of the virus from the patient, a rising titer of antibodies against Ad14, immunofluorescence of Ad14 virus particles in tissues, or fluids andtests.Treatments are mainly supportive; antivirals have been used by some clinicians but there are no studies that prove efficacy, only case reports.Complications of Ad14 are related to the severity of the; the majority of patients have no complications but hospitalized patients and people with weak immune systems may have mild to serious complications which are related to the organ system most damaged (eyes, GI tract, bladder and most notably, lung problems such asthat may lead to death).The majority of patients have an excellent prognosis; however, about 40% of infected patients may have a wide range of suboptimal outcomes, depending on the severity of the Ad14 infection.Ad14 infections can be reduced or prevented by careful hygiene methods.There is nocurrently available against Ad14." ,
"Addiction (Drug Abuse)" : "Drug abuse and addiction, now both grouped as drug use disorder, is a condition that is characterized by a self-destructive pattern of using a substance that leads to significant problems and distress, which may include tolerance to or withdrawal from the substance.Drug use disorder is unfortunately quite common, affecting more than 8% of people in the United States at some point in their lives.Dual diagnosis refers to the presence of both a drug-use issue in addition to a serious mental-health condition in an individual.Virtually any substance whose ingestion can result in a euphoric (high) feeling can be abused.Inhalants like household cleaners are some of the most commonly abused substances.While the specific physical and psychological effects of drug use disorder tend to vary based on the particular substance involved, the general effects of a substance use disorder involving any drug can be devastating.Although drug use disorders have no single cause, there are a number of biological, psychological, and social risk factors that can predispose a person to developing a chemical use disorder.Symptoms of a drug use disorder include recurrent drug use that results in legal problems, occurs in potentially dangerous situations, interfere with important obligations, results in social or relationship problems, tolerance, withdrawal, using a lot of the drug or for a long period of time, persistent desire to use the drug, unsuccessful efforts to stop using the drug, neglecting other aspects of life because of their drug use, and spending inordinate amounts of time or energy getting, using, or recovering from the effects of the drug.While the specific effects of drugs on the brain can somewhat vary depending on the drug that is being used, virtually every substance that is abused has an effect on the executive-functioning areas of the brain. Drugs particularly affect the brain's ability to inhibit actions that the person would otherwise delay or prevent.Since there is no single test that can definitively diagnose someone with a chemical use disorder, health-care professionals assess these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental-health information, as well as securing a physical examination and lab tests to assess the sufferer's medical state.Treatment services for drug use disorders remain largely underutilized by most people who suffer from these conditions.The primary goals of recovery are abstinence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation.During the initial stage of abstinence, a person who suffers from chemical dependency may need detoxification treatment to help avoid or lessen the effects of withdrawal.Often, much more challenging and time-consuming than recovery from the physical aspects of addiction is psychological addiction.The treatment of dual diagnosis seems to be more effective when treatment of the sufferer'sis integrated with the treatment of the individual's chemical dependency.Drug addiction increases the risk of a number of negative life stressors and conditions, particularly if left untreated.Recovery from a substance use disorder is usually characterized by episodes of remission and relapse." ,
"Addison Anemia (Pernicious Anemia)" : "Pernicious anemia is defined as a type of vitamin B12 deficiency that results from impaired uptake of vitamin B-12 due to the lack of a substance known as intrinsic factor (IF) produced by the stomach lining.Pernicious anemia is a condition caused by too little vitamin B12 in the body. It is one form of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia.Vitamin B12 helps the body make healthyand helps keep nerve cells healthy. It is found in animal foods, including meat, fish, eggs, milk, and other dairy products.The most common cause of pernicious anemia is the loss of stomach cells that make intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor helps the body absorb vitamin B12 in the intestine. The loss of parietal cells may be due to destruction by the body's own immune system.Pernicious anemia can cause permanent damage to nerves and other organs if it goes on for a long time without being treated. It also raises the risk for developing.Common signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, seen in pernicious anemia are:Pernicious anemia is diagnosed using family history and medical history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests and procedures.Pernicious anemia is easy to treat with vitamin B12 pills or shots as well aschanges.

"Allergy to Milk (Lactose Intolerance)" : "Lactose intolerance is an inability to digest lactose, the main sugar in milk, which gives rise to gastrointestinal symptoms.Lactose intolerance is caused by a deficiency of the intestinal enzyme lactase that splits lactose into two smaller sugars, glucose and galactose, and allows lactose to be absorbed from the intestine.Virtually all individuals are born with lactase and the ability to digest lactose. The disappearance of lactase is either genetically programmed to occur after childhood or is due to diseases of the lining of the intestine that destroys lactase.Lactose intolerance that occurs after age 21 (genetically-determined lactase deficiency usually occurs between ages 5-21) is rarely due to genetic lactase deficiency; it suggests another process is interfering with lactose.The primary signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance areOther signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance that may occur are:is not a symptom of lactose intolerance.The symptoms are similar in adults, toddlers, and infants,Among individuals, the severity of the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance vary and may be provoked by greater or lesser quantities of lactose. Most people are able to tolerate small amounts of lactose even if they are lactase deficient, for example. Some people develop severe symptoms with minimal intake of lactose.Lactose intolerance can be diagnosed by eliminating lactose from theand observing for a disappearance of symptoms or provocation of symptoms with a milk challenge,Tests that are useful for diagnosing lactose intolerance or lactase deficiency, include a lactose breath test, blood glucose test,, intestinal biopsy and genetic testing looking for the gene that controls the production of lactase,Lactose intolerance is treated with dietary changes,of lactase enzyme, correction of underlying conditions in the small intestine, and, possibly, by adaptation to increasing amounts of milk.Lactose intolerance is rarely due toin adults. Children with milk allergy, where it is more common, usually outgrow theby adulthood.Avoidance of milk and milk-containing products can lead to a dietary deficiency of calcium and vitamin D that, in turn, can lead to bone disease ().There is no curefor genetically-programmed lactase deficiency with lactose intolerance." ,

Scientists have discovered that mutations in the gene that produces the SOD1 enzyme were associated with some cases of familial ALS.No cure has yet been found for ALS. The first drug treatment for the disease -- riluzole (Rilutek) is believed to reduce damage to motor neurons by decreasing the release of glutamate.with ALS patients showed that riluzole prolongs survival by several months and extends the time before a patient needs ventilation support.

"Antisocial Personality Disorder" : "A personality disorder (PD) is a persistent pattern of internal experience and behavior that markedly differs from what is considered normal within the person's own culture.Personality disorders are grouped into clusters A, B, and C based on the dominating symptoms.Antisocial personality disorder is a diagnosis that is characterized by an enduring pattern of disregarding and violating the rights of others with symptoms having been present since 15 years of age and may include symptoms like breaking laws, repeated deceitfulness, starting fights, a lack of regard for their own safety or the safety of others, a lack of guilt and taking personal responsibility, a tendency to act impulsively, and irritability.Although not a formal diagnosis, psychopathy is thought to be a more severe form of antisocial personality disorder. Specifically, in order to be considered a psychopath, a person must have a lack of remorse or guilt about their actions in addition to demonstrating antisocial behaviors.Psychopaths tend to be highly suspicious or paranoid, even in comparison to individuals with antisocial personality disorder, which tends to lead the psychopathic person to interpret all aggression toward them as being arbitrary and unfair.Antisocial personality disorder is likely the result of a combination of biologic/genetic and environmental factors.Some theories about the biological risk factors for antisocial personality disorder include the malfunction of certain genes, hormones, or parts of the brain.Diagnoses often associated with antisocial personality disorder include substance-related disorders,(), and reading disorders.Theories regarding the life circumstances that increase the risk for developing antisocial personality disorder include a history of childhood physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; neglect, deprivation, or abandonment; associating with peers who engage in antisocial behavior; or having a parent who is either antisocial or alcoholic.Since there is no specific definitive test that can accurately diagnose antisocial personality disorder, health-care professionals perform a mental-health interview that assesses for the presence of antisocial symptoms. If the cultural context of the symptoms is not considered, antisocial personality disorder is often falsely diagnosed as being present.Research indicates that members of ethnic minorities tend to be wrongly diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, thereby inappropriately resulting in less treatment and more punishment for those individuals.While antisocial personality disorder can be quite resistant to treatment, the most effective interventions tend to be a combination of firm but fairand programming that emphasizes teaching the antisocial personality disorder individuals skills that can be used to live independently and productively within the rules and limits of society.While medications do not directly treat the behaviors that are associated with antisocial personality disorder, they can be useful in addressing conditions like,, and mood swings that often co-occur with this condition.If untreated, people with antisocial personality disorder are at risk for developing or worsening many other mental disorders, as well as for self-mutilation or dying from homicide or.Many people with antisocial personality disorder experience a remission of symptoms by the time they are 50 years old." ,

Risk factors include low socioeconomic status, family histories of anxiety, and mothers who were stressed during.A majority of children with separation anxiety disorder have school refusal as a symptom. Up to 80% of children who refuse school qualify for a diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder.Counseling is usually considered the best treatment method compared to medications. Types of counseling used to treat separation anxiety disorder include behavioral, cognitive, and individual psychotherapies, as well as parent counseling and guiding teachers on how to help the person with the disorder.SSRIs like fluvoxamine are considered the safest and most effective medications to treat separation anxiety disorder, followed by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), with benzodiazepines as a last resort.People with separation anxiety disorder are at higher risk for developing other mental-health problems, particularly anxiety disorders.Educating parents on ways to help their child cope with anxiety may be helpful in preventing the development of separation anxiety disorder." ,

Long QT syndrome is an inherited condition that can cause sudden death in young people. It can be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs,, electrical, defibrillation, implanted/, or ablation therapy.These are slow heart rhythms, which may arise from disease in the heart's electrical conduction system. Examples include sinus node dysfunction and.A slow heart rhythm due to an abnormal SA (sinus) node. Significant sinus node dysfunction that causes symptoms is treated with a pacemaker.A delay or complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the sinus node to the ventricles. The level of the block or delay may occur in the AV node or HIS-Purkinje system. The heart may beat irregularly and, often, more slowly. If serious, heart block is treated with a pacemaker." ,
"Arsenic Poisoning" : "Arsenic is an element (metalloid) that can combine with organic and inorganic substances.Inorganic arsenic is arsenic alone or combined with inorganic substances that are very toxic to most biologic systems, including humans.Organic arsenic is arsenic combined with organic substances and may be non-toxic or far less toxic to many biologic systems than inorganic arsenic.Symptoms of arsenic poisoning vary with the type andof the poison. Inorganic arsenic may cause abdominal pains, destruction of(hemolysis),, and death quickly. Lower concentrations of inorganic arsenic and organic arsenic cause far less severe symptoms.Diagnosis of arsenic poisoning is made by determining inorganic and organic levels of arsenic in the blood and urine.Treatment of arsenic poisoning in acute toxic poisonings needs to begin quickly; treatment involves removal of arsenic by, chelating agents, replacement of red blood cells, and if ingested, bowel cleansing.Acute toxic inorganic arsenic poisoning has only a fair to poor outcome. Chronic poisoning has a better outcome.Arsenic is found in groundwater, many chemicals, and foods. If arsenic is in the organic form, it is likely nontoxic or weakly toxic to humans, but inorganic arsenic can also be found in similar locations and materials and in high concentrations in industrial processes. In 2013, the FDA made recommendations that less than 10 parts per billion of arsenic was acceptable for levels in apple juice. Levels for arsenic have yet to be FDA approved for rice (still under study), although groundwater levels that provide arsenic to rice are FDA set at less than 10 parts per billion." ,

In some cases, treatment may not be needed.Medicines often are used as the first course of treatment. Treatments used for children and adults are similar.Adults with ITP who have very low platelet counts or problems with bleeding often are treated. Adults who have milder cases of ITP may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts.The acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months. Children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), usually are treated.Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding condition in which the blood doesn't clot as it should. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets.Platelets stick together (clot) to seal smallor breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.There are two types of ITP. Acute ITP is a short-term illness that mainly affects children and often occurs after a viral infection. Most children get well quickly without any treatment. Adults who have ITP most often have chronic (long-lasting) ITP. Symptoms can vary a great deal, and some adults who have mild ITP don't need treatment.In most cases, an autoimmune response is believed to cause ITP. Normally your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known.ITP can't be passed from one person to another.ITP can affect children and adults of all ages. Women are 2 to 3 times more likely than men to get chronic ITP.People who have ITP may have signs of bleeding, such as(purpura) that appear for no reason or tiny red dots (petechiae) that are visible on the skin.Bleeding in ITP also occurs in the form of nosebleeds, bleeding gums, menstrual bleeding that's heavier than usual, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Bleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but it can be life threatening when it occurs.ITP is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and results from blood tests.Treatment for ITP is based on how much and how often you're bleeding and your platelet count. Medicines often are used as the first course of treatment. Treatments used for children and adults are similar.The spleen is sometimes removed if treatment with medicine fails to keep the platelet level high enough to prevent bleeding.You can't prevent ITP, but you can prevent its complications. Talk to your doctor about what medicines are safe for you, protect yourself from injuries that can cause bruising or bleeding, and seek treatment if any signs of infection develop.For most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition.

Symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), distorted perceptions (hypnagogic hallucinations), inability to move or talk (), disturbed nocturnal, and automatic behavior.Narcolepsy usually begins in teenagers or young adults and affects both sexes equally.Abnormalities in the structure and function of a particular group of nerve cells in the brain called hypocretin neurons are thought to play a role in the development of narcolepsy.The diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on a clinical evaluation, specific questionnaires,logs or diaries, and the results of sleep laboratory tests (polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test).Treatment options for narcolepsy include drug and behavioral modification therapies and disease-specific education of the patient and family members. The treatment is individualized, depending on the types and severity of the symptoms, the life conditions of the patients, and the specific goals of therapy.Optimal management usually takes weeks to months to achieve and requires continued communication among the physician, patient, family members, and others.Alerting medications are used for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness. Amphetamines and methylphenidate (Ritalin) are general CNS stimulants that decrease sleepiness and improve alertness. Modafinil (Provigil) and armondafinil (Nuvigil) have alerting effects similar to those of the traditional stimulants but has less undesirable side effects.Anticataplectic medications are used to treat cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.

"Gas (Intestinal Gas (Belching, Bloating, Flatulence))" : "The intestine normally contains gas that is rapidly transmitted through the small intestine to the colon. The amount of gas that is normally present is dependent on the effects of colonic bacteria on the undigested food that reaches the colon and the speed with which the gas passes through theand is passed. In normal individuals, most of the lower intestinal gas that is passed (flatus) is gas produced in the colon and is not transmitted from the upper intestines.The definition of excessive gas varies by individual, usually based on what they have considered normal in the past. Some individuals consider excessive gas to be excessive belching or excessive burping (burping a lot), others excessive passing of gas (flatulence), and still others as the sensation of fullness in the abdomen. Although everyone goes through periods of excessive gas, particularly flatulence, it is only when the symptoms become chronic that people become concerned.The most common normal cause of belching is excessive gas in the stomach that comes from swallowed air. However, discomfort in the abdomen for any reason also may lead to excessive belching. Therefore, belching does not always indicate the presence of excessive gas in the stomach. It is not difficult usually to differentiate between excessive gas in the stomach and other causes of excessive gas. If the problem is gas in the stomach, belching brings relief. If it is not gas in the stomach belching does not bring relief. Although excessive belching may be a sign of excessive gas, it usually is not and is rather a sign of abdominal discomfort of many causes or a learned habit of swallowing and immediately regurgitating the air as a belch. Rarely excessive belching (burping a lot) is due to swallowed air during acute psychiatric issues associated with.is the subjective feeling that the abdomen is full than it should be, but does not necessarily mean that the abdomen is enlarged. Distention is the objective enlargement of the abdomen.

The maximum number of farts for a normal person is 20 per day. The number that defines a lot of burping has not been determined.Flatulence results from the production of gas by bacteria within the intestines (usually the colon) when they digest dietary sugars and polysaccharides that reach the colon undigested.Increased gas is not caused by the() or most parasitic or bacterial intestinal infections.

Cramps and severe pain suggest causes other than gas, for example, intestinal obstruction that also can lead to abdominal distention and discomfort.Remedies for truly excessive gas include changes inand suppression of intestinal bacteria that produce the gas. There is no evidence that digestive enzymes, activated charcoal, and simethicone (Gas-X, Mylanta, and others).The remedy for excessive belching not due to excessive gas is by learning new physical habits such aswith the mouth open.Foul smelling gas (flatus) is not synonymous (the same) with excessive gas.

This limits how much food you can eat. Next, a Y-shaped section of the small intestine is attached to the pouch to allow food to bypass the duodenum as well as the first portion of the jejunum. This causes reduced calorie and nutrient absorption. This procedure can now be done with a laparoscope (a thin telescope-like instrument for viewing inside the abdomen) in some people. This involves using small incisions and generally has a more rapid recovery time.: In this more complicated gastric bypass operation, the lower portion of the stomach is removed. The small pouch that remains is connected directly to the final segment of the small intestine, thus completely bypassing both the duodenum and jejunum.

The brain may be imaged in a variety of ways including CT,and.Treatment and prognosis of brain lesions depend upon the underlying illness or injury, and the amount of damage sustained by the brain.Neurons are the cells that process and transmit information in the brain. Each cell has two connectors, the axon and dendrite. The axon of one neuron connects with the dendrite of another at junction or synapse. Special chemicals called neurotransmitters help transfer the electrical impulse across the synapse so that one neuron can excite another.Glial cells are located between neurons and help support their activity.Microglial cells are part of the immune system within brain tissue helping clear dead cells and other debris.Astrocytes help clear neurotransmitter chemicals so that the synapse can be ready to react to the next signal that might arrive.Oligodendrocytes produce and maintain the myelin sheath that coats and insulates the axon making electrical conduction more efficient.Ependymal cells produce CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) which is located within the ventricles of the brain and in the subarachnoid space that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.

The active trophozoite attaches to the lining of the small intestine with a sucker and is responsible for causing the signs and symptoms of giardiasis.The trophozoite cannot live long outside of the body, therefore it cannot spread the infection to others. The inactive cyst, on the other hand, can exist for prolonged periods outside the body.When it is ingested, stomach acid activates the cyst, and the cyst develops into the disease-causing trophozoite. It takes ingestion of only ten cysts to cause infection. Trophozoites are important not only because they cause the symptoms of giardiasis, but also because they produce the cysts that exit the body in the feces and spread the infection to others.Cysts of Giardia are present in the feces of infected persons. Thus, the infection is spread from person to person by contamination of food with feces, or by direct fecal-oral contamination. Cysts also survive in water, for example in fresh water lakes and streams. As a result, giardiasis is the most common cause of water-borne, parasitic illness in the U.S.Domestic mammals (for example,, cats, calves) and wild mammals (for example, beavers) can become infected with Giardia; however, it is not clear how often domestic or wild mammals transmit giardiasis to humans.Giardiasis also has occurred as outbreaks from recreational water sources such aspools, water parks, and hot tubs, most likely because of an infected user rather than a source of water that was contaminated." ,

Domestic violence is most effectively assessed when the professional asks questions that call for more than a yes or no answer and do not directly inquire about domestic abuse, at least earlier during any assessment interview.Domestic abuse is treated by establishing and maintaining the safety of the victim, providing appropriate legal consequences to the batterer, addressing the emotional impact on the victim and the problems of the abuser, particularly if one of the problems includes alcohol or other substance abuse.The prognosis of domestic violence can be quite negative if it goes on untreated, in that the emotional and physical consequences of continued abuse can be severe and even end in homicide. Treatment and enhancing social supports to the victim can improve prognosis.Prevention of domestic violence involves providing economic opportunity, mentors, role models, organized community programs for youth and families, a school environment that promotes prevention of abusiveness in any relationship, and adult family members who are nurturing and who provide consistent, structured support." ,

"Fibrocystic Disease of the Pancreas (Cystic Fibrosis)" : "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is anthat affects the secretory glands, including the mucus and sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis mostly affects the, pancreas,,, sinuses, and sex organs.CF is due to a mutation in the CF gene on chromosome 7. The CF gene encodes a protein known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The abnormal CFTR protein in patients with CF leads to disruption of chloride channels on the cells.CF is characterized by the production of abnormal mucus that is excessively thick and sticky. The abnormal mucus leads to blockages within the lungs and airways. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections that can damage the lungs.Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have cystic fibrosis. Over time, permanent damage to the lungs can cause severeproblems.The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in the pancreas. As a result, the digestive enzymes from the pancreas can't reach the small intestine, causing impaired absorption ofand proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition.Due to the defect in chloride channels, CF fibrosis also causes the sweat to become very salty.Every person inherits two CFTR genes -- one from each parent. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; children who inherit a faulty gene from each parent will have cystic fibrosis.Children who inherit one faulty gene and one normal gene will be CF carriers. Cystic fibrosis carriers usually have no symptoms of cystic fibrosis, but they can pass the faulty gene on to their children.About 30,000 people in the United States have cystic fibrosis. It is one of the most common inherited diseases among Caucasians. About 1,000 new cases of cystic fibrosis are diagnosed each year.The symptoms of cystic fibrosis vary from person to person and over time.Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis based on the results from various tests. The most commonly used test is a, which measures theof chloride in sweat. Direct genetic testing to identify the CF mutation is also used. Most U.S. States screen newborns for cystic fibrosis.Cystic fibrosis has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. Treatment may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines,, and more. Early treatment for cystic fibrosis can improve both quality of life and lifespan.As treatments for cystic fibrosis continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have cystic fibrosis are living into their forties, fifties, and older." ,

The first bone, closest to the palm, is the proximal phalanx. The second bone is the middle phalanx. The smallest and farthest from the hand is the distal phalanx. The thumb does not have a middle phalanx.Traumatic injury is the main cause of broken fingers, and it occurs from playing sports, workplace, injury, punching something, falls, or in other accidents.The main symptoms of a broken finger areimmediately after the, and sometimes a deformed finger. If the trauma is severe, broken bones may be exposed through the soft tissues (called a).Ifor swelling limits the motion or use of the fingers, if the finger becomes numb, or if the injury includes a laceration, crushed tissue, or exposure of bone, seek medical care.The mainstay of diagnosing finger fractures is an X-ray.Treatment of broken fingers depends on the type of fracture and the particular bone in the finger that is injured. Surgery may be required for fractures causing significant deformity or involving a joint.Complications of a broken finger can include join stiffness, rotation, nonunion, and infection.After reduction, immobilization, and four to six weeks of healing, the prognosis for healing is excellent for a broken finger.The best medicine forof finger fractures is safety.

"Folling Disease (Phenylketonuria)" : "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disease that's inherited that increases the levels of phenylalanine in the blood. If left untreated, high phenylalanine levels can cause intellectual disability and other problems. Phenylketonuria disease was discovered in 1934 by Dr. A. Folling.Signs and symptoms of PKU vary from mild to severe depending upon phenylalanine levels. Infants appear normal until a few months old when they start to showChildren with untreated PKU also may have lighter skin and hair than other family members, and also may develop a musty or mouse-like odor due to excess phenylalanine. These are classic PKU symptoms.Less severe forms of PKU (sometimes termed variant PKU and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia may develop less severe symptoms with a smaller risk of.Women with PKU that have uncontrolled phenylalanine levels can havethat are at significant risk for intellectual disability, low birth weight, heart defects,, behavior problems, and slow growth.PKU occurs in about 1/10,000 to15,000 births, but classic PKU symptoms are rarely seen because of newborn screening tests for the disease.Mutations in the PAH gene cause phenylketonuria. Some mutations in this gene allow the enzyme to retain some activity resulting in variant PKU and/or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia.PKU is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern so that both copies of the gene in the cell have mutations. Consequently, the autosomal recessive condition in both parents carry one copy of the mutated gene and parents typically do not show symptoms. Symptoms of PKU develop in their children when both parents donate one autosomal recessive condition to the newborn.PKU has many different names, for example, phenylketonuria, PKU, Folling Disease, Folling's Disease, and phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency disease.PKU does not shorten a person's life expectancy, with or without treatment.Blood tests for PKU is required for infants (newborns) in all 50 states.There is a 1 in 4 chance of having a PKU infant when both parents are genetic carriers. The approximate incident rate of PKU in the US is 0.01%. This means about 74 infants every day are diagnosed with PKU.PKU patients usually are treated in a special metabolic disease clinic with restrictions on foods that contain phenylalanine and are given amino acids,, minerals, and other micronutrients along with close monitoring of phenylalanine levels.A PKUbans meat, fish, chicken, eggs, nuts, beans, milk, and other dairy products.

"Foot, Broken (Broken Foot)" : "The bones in the foot may be broken in many ways including direct blows, crush injuries, falls and overuse or stress.Signs and symptoms of a broken foot may include pain, limping, swelling, bruising, and refusal to bear weight on the affected foot.Initial treatment may include RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation). Rest may include the use of crutches to limit weight bearing.X-rays often help make the diagnosis butor(CT scan) may be needed to help visualize the injury.Treatment of foot fractures depend upon which bone is broken but many fractures are treated with a compression dressing, a stiff- soled shoe, boot, and weight bearing as tolerated.Some foot fractures require surgery to repair the damage.Complications of foot fractures include non-union at the fracture site,if a joint is involved, and infection if the skin is broken.Healing and recovery time for a broken foot depends upon the type of fracture and the bone(s) involved.The hindfoot consists of the talus that forms the base of the ankle joint where it meets the tibia (shin bone) and the calcaneous or heel bone.Ligaments from both the talus and the heel bone span the ankle joint and attach to the tibia and fibula (the other shin bone) to provide stability.The midfoot consists of the navicular, the cuboid, and the three cuneiform bones. The midfoot is where inversion and supination of the foot occurs. These motions allow the sole of the foot to turn inwards and upwards.The fiveare connected to each toe.The toe bones are called phalanges (single = phalanx) with the great toe having two and the other four toes having three each. These bones are named based upon their relationship to the body: proximal, middle and distal. Proximal means closest to the center of the body while distal is furthest from the center. The toenails are located over the digital phalanges.The arch of the foot is maintained by the plantar fascia, a thick fibrous band of tissue that runs from the calcaneus to the metatarsal, preventing the bones of the foot from flattening.There are places in the foot where two bones meet to form a joint. Each joint has its own set of structures that help maintain stability.Injuries to the foot include fractures of the bone,of the ligaments that stabilize the joints, andof the muscles and tendons that move the foot. Joints can also become inflamed (arthritis). Arthritis can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).Foot fractures account for 10% of all the broken bones in the body, and the mechanism of injury usually can give a clue as to what bone might be injured.Fractures of the calcaneus (heel bone) usually occur when a person jumps or falls from a height, landing directly on their. The force of the landing may also be transmitted up the body to cause fractures of the ankle, knee, hip, and lumbar spine.Injuries to the midfoot, the, and phalanges often are caused by a direct blow sustained when a kick goes awry or from a crush injury when a heavy object is dropped on the foot.Twisting injuries can cause bones to break. For example, fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal occur when the ankle rolls inward and a fragment of the bone is pulled off (avulsed) by the peroneus tendon.The most common causes of foot injuries include falls; crush injuries (including impacts from a heavy object or an automobile accident) missed steps, and stress/overuse injuries." ,

"Foul Breath (Bad Breath)" : "Bad breath, or halitosis, is characterized by an unpleasant odor of the mouth.Causes of bad breath include food, tobacco products, poor, health problems,, oral infections, dental problems, or medications.Symptoms of bad breath include unpleasant odor or taste in the mouth,, or white coating on the tongue.Treatments for bad breath include proper dental hygiene, mouthwash,-free gum, quitting, and changing bad habits.Bad breath can usually be prevented by proper, quitting, and avoiding foods that cause bad breath odors.: Food is a primary source of bad odors that come from the mouth. Some foods, such as garlic, onions, spicy foods, exotic spices (such as curry), some cheeses, fish, and acidicsuch as coffee can leave a lingering smell. Most of the time the odor is short lived. Other foods may get stuck in the, promoting the growth of bacteria and dental plaques, which causes bad breath odor. Low carbohydrate diets may also cause ketone breath. These diets cause the body to burn fat as its energy source. The end-product of making this energy is ketones, which cause a fruity acetone-like odor on the breath when exhaled. This fruity odor in a diabetic might indicate uncontrolled blood sugars.:andcan leave chemicals that remain in the mouth. Smoking can also precipitate other bad-breath causes such asor.: When a person does not brush or floss his/her teeth regularly, food particles remaining in the mouth can rot and cause bad odors. Poor dental care can lead to a buildup of plaque in the mouth, which causes an odor of its own. Plaque buildup on the teeth can also lead to an unhealthy condition called periodontal (gum) disease. When plaque hardens, it is referred to as tartar (calculus). Tartar holds bacteria that can irritate the gums and lead to gum disease. The mild form of gum disease is called; if gingivitis is not treated, it can advance to periodontitis.:,,() and other throat infections, the,(flu),(tonsilloliths),,, postnasal drip,,(or),, other stomach orproblems, and somediseases or kidney diseases may be associated with bad breath.Also called, dry mouth can also cause bad breath. Saliva helps moisten and cleanse the mouth, and when the body does not product enough saliva, bad breath may result. Dry mouth may be caused by salivary gland problems, connective tissue disorders (Sjgren's syndrome), medications, orthrough the mouth.: Many medications used to treatcan cause dry mouth, another cause of halitosis.

"Fragile X Syndrome" : "Fragile X syndrome (also called Fragile X) is the most common inherited form of mental problems (mental retardation).Fragile X syndrome is caused by changes in a single X chromosome ().does not produce enough protein (FMRP) that works cell communication.Normal X genes that controllevels have promoter regions consisting of about 6 to 40 CGG; Fragile X genes have about 55 to 200 (termed premutation) or more than about 200 regions (termed full mutation).About 100 trillion cells make up aand each should have 46 chromosomes, but males have only one X chromosome; so, if it contains achromosome, the effect of the lack of FMRP is more significant than in females.Approximately one in 3,600 to 4,000 males is affected by the full mutation of thegene, and about one in 468 males has the premutation form of thegene; about one in 151 females in the general population has the premutation while about one in 4,000 to 6,000 females is affected by the full mutation (these are estimates only).The Fragile X gene is only carried on an X chromosome; both males and females may transmit a Fragile X () gene on their X chromosome so.Theof Fragile X syndrome have five general categories where individuals often show altered or arrested development.Each individual may exhibit variations in the above five categories.Currently, there is no cure for Fragile X syndrome nor are there any definitive treatments other than helping the individual develop to their maximal potential through education; therapies such as speech, language, behavioral, and physical; and other therapies. Fragile X detects FMR1 DNA (or Southern blot methods)Medication therapy may only help certain individuals with certain severe problems and should be prescribed only by the patients' doctors; there is no medication that can cure Fragile X syndrome.Adults with Fragile X syndrome may benefit from a team approach to help the patient adjust to independent living, if possible.IIf a family member has been diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome, other family members may want to be tested to determine if they carry a Fragile X chromosome; there are several accurate DNA tests available for gene testing (see above) and for determining the amount of FMRP produced.are also available.Research is ongoing; gene therapy, gene activation, and FMRP replacement therapy are several areas that may lead to treatments, or possible cure or, in the future.Several national organizations may provide additional information on Fragile X syndrome (for example, American Association on Mental Retardation and the National Institute ofand Human Development)." ,

Once the brain cells are injured, they lose their ability to communicate with other cells, leading to dysfunction.Signs and symptoms of dementia are varied, but typically include memory loss, problems with speaking or communicating (word-finding difficulties, repetition), problems focusing, impairments in judgment, struggles with completing tasks, or even difficulty comprehending what is seen.The types of dementia include, vascular dementa, and. Other types include dementia associated withor. Senile dementia () is a term that was once used to describe all dementias; this term is no longer used as a diagnosis.The stages of dementia are used when a progressive dementia has been diagnosed. The stages include:Dementia is diagnosed after a series of assessments, including a physical evaluation and determination of the history of any problems. Memory tests, imaging studies, and blood work may exclude other problems which might mimic dementia. The diagnosis of dementia can take a long time.The treatment for dementia is primarily supportive. Prescription medications cannot reverse or stop the process. Environmental changes, a structured schedule, regular, and staying engaged with others can all be beneficial.Home care for dementia can be beneficial for patients and families, as a way for patients to remain close to family members. However, caregivers should confirm that they have help to avoid burnout.Prescription drugs to treat dementia include donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), galantamine (Razadyne), and memantine (Namenda). A new combination of donepezil and memantine (Namzaric) was recently approved by the FDA.Although there is no way to absolutely prevent dementia, modifying the risk factors of,, alcohol intake, and keepingas well-controlled as possible, as well as exercising regularly can help.The prognosis for a person with dementia is individual.

"Functional Dyspepsia (Dyspepsia)" : "Indigestion (dyspepsia) is a functional disease in which the gastrointestinal (GI) organs, primarily the stomach and first part of the small intestine (and occasionally the), function abnormally. It is a chronic disease in which the symptoms fluctuate in frequency and intensity usually over many months or years. It may occur every day or intermittently for days or weeks at a time followed by days or weeks of relief (a pattern referred to as periodicity).Theories of the cause of indigestion include abnormal input from intestinal sensory nerves, abnormal processing of input from the sensory nerves, and abnormal stimulation of theby motor nerves.The primary symptoms of indigestion areThe symptoms most often are provoked by eating.Indigestion frequently occurs, though the majority of the time it is actually caused by.Indigestion is diagnosed on the basis of typical symptoms and the absence of other GI diseases, particularly acid-related diseases (,,, and ulcers), and non-gastrointestinal diseases that might give rise to the symptoms.Since the heart sits near the stomach, there often is confusion about what is causing lower chest or upper. Therefore, indigestion should be considered in anyone with lower, andshould be considered in anyone with upper abdominal pain. Occasionally, the discomfort of indigestion can be felt in the back.Testing in indigestion is directed primarily at excluding the presence of other GI diseases and non-GI diseases. Some patients may require specific testing of certain GI functions.It is important to exclude other causes for the indigestion since their treatment will be different than that for indigestion without a clear cause.Treatment in indigestion for which there is no other cause found, is primarily with education as well as smooth muscle relaxant and promotility drugs. There also may be a role for anti-depressant drugs and dietary changes.Because acid reflux is so common, a trial of potent stomach acid suppression often is used as the initial treatment.Many people are able to identify specific foods that provoke their indigestion. Despite this fact, there are few foods whose avoidance can be universally recommended since not all people with indigestion have trouble with the same foods. There also are no foods or diets that can be recommended for preventing indigestion other than those that eliminated foods that provoke symptoms.There is no evidence that home remedies or natural remedies prevent indigestion.Future advances in the treatment of indigestion depend on a clearer understanding of its many cause(s)." ,
"Functional Hemispherectomy (Surgical Options for Epilepsy)" : "Surgery to remove the area of the brain producing seizures.Surgery to interrupt the nerve pathways through whichimpulses spread within the brain.The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections, called lobes -- the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in which the seizure focus is located within the temporal lobe, is the most common type of epilepsy inand adults. In a, brain tissue in the temporal lobe is resected, or cut away, to remove the seizure focus. The anterior (front) and mesial (deep middle) portions of the temporal lobe are the areas most often involved. Extratemporal resection involves removing brain tissue from areas outside of the temporal lobe.This is surgery to remove isolated-- areas of injury or defect such as aor malformed blood vessel -- that are responsible for seizure activity. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed.The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the two halves (hemispheres) of the brain. A corpus callosotomy is an operation in which all or part of this structure is cut, disabling communication between the hemispheres and preventing the spread of seizures from one side of the brain to the other. This procedure, sometimes called split-brain surgery, is for patients with extreme forms of uncontrollable epilepsy who have intense seizures that can lead to violent falls and potentially serious injury.This is a variation of a hemispherectomy, a radical procedure in which one entire hemisphere, or one half of the brain, is removed. With a functional hemispherectomy, one hemisphere is disconnected from the rest of the brain, but only a limited area of brain tissue is removed. This surgery generally is limited to children younger than 13 years old who have one hemisphere that is not functioning normally.This procedure is used to help control seizures that begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow(transections) in the brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the movement of seizure impulses but do not disturb normal brain activity, leaving the person's abilities intact." ,
"Functional Heart Murmur (Heart Murmur)" : "Turbulent blood flow within the heart causes abnormal sounds called murmurs.Most murmurs are functional, or physiologic, and are normal variants. They are often known as innocent murmurs.Some murmurs are due to abnormal function of the valves in the heart. The valves may have narrowing (stenosis) or they may leak (regurgitation).Holes in the septum or wall that divides theor ventricles (septal defects) may cause a murmur.A murmur is a physical finding and not a structural problem within the heart itself. Treatment is aimed at the underlying condition.Each heartbeat has two phases, systole when the heart pumps and diastole when the heart chambers fill with blood.Blood enters thefrom the body via the vena cava.It travels through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.A systolic heartbeat sends the blood through the pulmonary valve, which separates the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, to the lung.In the lung, oxygen is delivered to red blood cells and carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is removed.The oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium where it travels through the mitral valve into the left ventricle.The systolic heartbeat also causes the left side of the heart to contract and send the blood through the aortic valve that separates the left ventricle and the.Blood passes through the aorta to the body delivering oxygen to the body's tissues." ,

"Deep Vein Thrombosis" : "There are both superficial and deep veins in the limbs or extremities (arms and legs). Ain the deep veins is a concern because it can cause life-threatening complications.A(thrombus) in the deep venous system of the leg becomes dangerous if a piece of the blood clot breaks off or travels through the blood stream, through the heart, and into the pulmonary arteries forming a. A person may not have signs or symptoms of a small(blood clot in the), but a large embolism can be fatal.Risk factors for blood clot formation include immobility, a genetic tendency toward blood clotting, and injury to veins or adjacent tissues occurs.Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include:The diagnosis ofcan be suggested by blood tests and confirmed byor other imaging tests.Treatment oftypically involves blood thinning medications (anticoagulants) unless they cannot be used in a patient (contraindicated). In that situation, an inferior vena cava filter is potentially considered.Complications ofincludepulmonary embolism (PE) and post-phlebitic syndrome.There are other types of thrombosis such as:Arteries have thin muscles within their walls to be able to withstand the pressure of the heart pumping blood to the far reaches of the body. Veins don't have a significant muscle lining, and there is nothing pumping blood back to the heart except physiology. Blood returns to the heart because the body's large muscles squeeze the veins as they contract in their normal activity of moving the body. The normal activities of moving the body returns the blood back to the heart. Being mobile causes this blood return system to fail, and the resulting stagnated blood may clot.There are two types of veins in the arm or leg; superficial veins and deep veins. Superficial veins lie just below the skin and are easily seen on the surface. Deep veins, as their name implies, are located deep within the muscles of the extremity. Blood flows from the superficial veins into the deep venous system through small perforator veins. Superficial and perforator veins have one-way valves within them that allow blood to flow only in the direction of the heart when the veins are squeezed.A blood clot (thrombus) in the deep venous system of the leg or arm, in itself, is not dangerous. It becomes potentially life-threatening when a piece of the blood clot breaks off  and embolizes, travels through the circulation system through the heart, and enters into one of the pulmonary arteries and becomes lodged. This can prevent blood from flowing properly through the lung and decreasing the amount of oxygen absorbed and distributed back to the body.Diagnosis and treatment of a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is meant to preventpulmonary embolism.in the superficial veins do not pose a danger of causing pulmonary emboli because the perforator vein valves act as a sieve to prevent clots from entering the deep venous system. They are usually not at risk of causing pulmonary embolism." ,

"Deglutition (Swallowing)" : "Dysphagia means difficulty swallowing.Swallowing is a complex action involving the muscles and nerves within the pharynx and, a swallowing center in the brain, and nerves that connect the pharynx and esophagus to the swallowing center.Dysphagia should be differentiated from odynophagia and globus sensation.General causes of dysphagia can be grouped as either oropharyngeal or esophageal. Specific causes include physical obstruction of the pharynx or esophagus, diseases of the brain, diseases of the smooth muscle of the esophagus, diseases of skeletal muscle of the pharynx, and miscellaneous diseases.Symptoms of dysphagia may be swallowing-related or non-swallowing-related.The differential diagnosis of dysphagia includes odynophagia and globus sensation, tracheo-esophageal fistula, rumination syndrome,(), and.Evaluation and diagnosis of the cause of dysphagia includes history, physical examination,, X-rays,, esophageal impedence, esophageal acid testing, and tests for the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy and metabolic myopathies.The treatment of dysphagia depends primarily on its cause.Newer diagnostic procedures for the evaluation and diagnosis of the cause of dysphagia include high resolution or 3D manometry and endoscopic.Food is first chewed well in the mouth and mixed with saliva.The tongue then propels the chewed food into the throat (pharynx).The soft palate elevates to prevent the food from entering the posterior end of the nasal passages, and the upper pharynx contracts, pushing the food (referred to as a bolus) into the lower pharynx. At the same time, the voice box (larynx) is pulled upwards by muscles in the neck, and, as a result, thebends downwards. This dual action closes off the opening to the larynx and windpipe (trachea) and prevents passing food from entering the larynx and trachea.The contraction of the muscular pharynx continues as a progressing, circumferential wave into the lower pharynx pushing the food along.A ring of muscle that encircles the upper end of the esophagus, known as the upper esophageal sphincter, relaxes, allowing the wave of contraction to push the food from the lower pharynx on into the esophagus.

In general, in most staging methods, the higher the number assigned (usually between 0 to 4), the more aggressive the cancer type or more widespread is the cancer in the body. Staging methods differ from cancer to cancer and need to be individually discussed with your health-care provider.Treatment protocols vary according to the type and stage of the cancer. Most treatment protocols are designed to fit the individual patient's disease. However, most treatments include at least one of the following and may include all: surgery,, and.There are many listed home remedies and alternative treatments for cancers but patients are strongly recommended to discuss these before use with their cancer doctors.The prognosis of cancer can range from excellent to poor.

These tumors have high recurrence rates but a very low chance of progression to higher stages.High-grade T1 tumors have high chances of recurrence and progression and may need additional treatment in the form of BCG or chemotherapy instillation in the bladder. Patients unresponsive to these may be best treated by radical cystectomy (bladder removal).Radical cystectomy provides the best chances of cure in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.Systemic, usually intravenous chemotherapy is used in patients with metastatic disease at presentation or those in which bladder cancer cells are present outside the bladder wall or induring radical cystectomy.The prognosis of bladder cancer ranges from good to poor and depends on the stage and grade of the cancer.People may reduce the risk of bladder cancer by notand by avoiding environmental carcinogens.Informational and support groups are available for anyone concerned about bladder cancer." ,

It is therefore crucial to see a health professional as soon as you notice symptoms of depression in yourself, your friends, or family.The first step in getting appropriate treatment for a depressive disorder is a complete physical and psychological evaluation to determine whether the person, in fact, has a depressive disorder.Depression is not a weakness but a serious mental illness with biological, psychological, and social aspects to its cause, symptoms, and treatment. A person cannot will it away. Untreated or undertreated, it can worsen or return.There are many safe and effective medications, particularly the SSRI antidepressants, that can be of great help in the treatment of depression.For full recovery from a mood disorder, regardless of whether there is a precipitating factor or it seems to come out of the blue, treatments with medications, phototherapy and/or() or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as well asand participation in support groups are often necessary.In the future, through depression research and education, we will continue to improve our treatments, decrease society's burden, and hopefully improve prevention of this illness." ,

Until validated criteria are available, it seems reasonable to do screening endoscopies in GERD patients who cannot be taken off acid suppression therapy after two to three years.The diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus rests upon seeing (at) a pink esophageal lining that extends a short distance (usually less than 2.5 inches) up the esophagus from the gastroesophageal junction and finding intestinal type cells (goblet cells) on biopsy of the lining.There is a small but definite increased risk of() in patients with Barrett's esophagus.If the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is uncertain, a second opinion should be obtained because this diagnosis may generate greater costs than GERD alone as well as problems with obtaining life, health, and disability insurance. Therefore, it is critical to make an accurate diagnosis.The treatment for Barrett's esophagus is, in general, essentially the same as for GERD. Treatment of GERD either medical (acid-suppressing drugs) or surgical (), does not result in the disappearance of Barrett's esophagus or in a reducedrisk.Dysplasia is a cellular process that occurs in the Barrett's lining and indicates a heightened risk of. Therefore, periodic endoscopic biopsies, of the Barrett's mucosa are performed to look for dysplasia.The recommended frequency for initial endoscopic biopsy surveillance in Barrett's without dysplasia is twice annually. If no dysplasia is found, surveillance then is performed every three years.If low grade dysplasia is present, endoscopic biopsy surveillance should be done every six months indefinitely.The management of high grade dysplasia involves repeating the biopsies soon after the high grade dysplasia is discovered to exclude an accompanying cancer.

The level of blood sugar is measured, and then levels of insulin and antibodies can be measured to confirm type 1 vs..Type 1 diabetes is treated with insulin and lifestyle changes. Specifically, meal planning to ensure carbohydrate intake matches insulin dosing.Complications of type 1 diabetes are,,, and nerve problems () such as loss of feeling in the.can also be a complication of type 1 diabetes.Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, however, keeping blood sugar at healthy levels may delay or prevent symptoms or complications. There is currently no cure, and most cases of type 1 diabetes have no known cause.The prognosis or life-expectancy for a person with type 1 diabetes is good if blood sugar control is kept within a healthy range. The life expectancy traditionally has been about 11 years less than average, but that is changing as the prevention of complications improves and technology such as insulin pumps makes it easier for people to keep their blood sugar in a healthy range." ,
"Diabetes, Type 2 (Type 2 Diabetes)" : "is a condition in which cells cannot use blood sugar (glucose) efficiently for energy. This happens when the cells become insensitive to insulin and the blood sugar gradually gets too high.There are two types of, type 1 and type 2. In type 2, the pancreas still makes insulin, but the cells cannot use it very efficiently. In, the pancreas cannot make insulin due to auto-immune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells.Type 2 can be caused by:Risk factors include:The signs and symptoms of this type of this type ofare sometimes subtle. The major symptom is often being overweight. Other symptoms and signs include:Often there are no specific symptoms of the condition and it goes undiagnosed until routine blood tests are ordered.A blood sugar level more than 125 when fasting or more than 200 randomly is a diagnosis for.Treatment is withand lifestyle changes that include eating less sugary foods, and foods that are high in simple carbohydrates (sugar, bread, and pasta.)Sometimes a person will need to take drugs, for example, metformin (Glucophage).People with both types of diabetes need monitor their blood sugar levels often to avoid high () andlevels ().Complications include heart and, neuropathy, sexual and/or urinary problems,, and.This health condition can be prevented by following a low glycemic load, staying physically active, and getting regular medical screenings.The prognosis for a person with this health condition is estimated to be a life expectancy of 10 years less than a person without diabetes. However, good blood sugar control and taking steps to prevent complications is shortening this gap and people with the condition are living longer than ever before. It can be reversed with diligent attention to changing lifestyle behaviors.If you have type 2, you can lowerlevels with diet,, and oral drugs that either make the body more sensitive to insulin or help the pancreas release more insulin.In, the pancreas cannot make any insulin and people have to depend on injections of insulin to lower blood sugar.Over time, people with type 2 also can require insulin. This happens when the pancreas wears out.Some ethnic groups have a higherincidence of it. African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Pacific islanders are all at increased risk.Other causes include unhealthy lifestyle habits, for example, if you:Age (being over age 45)A family history of diabetesAre of a race or ethnic group with a genetic predisposition for this type of diabetesBeing overweightHave hadorHave otherconditions such as, lowor good, or highIf you are overweight orIf you are sedentary (you don't exercise and are not physically active)If you watch more than 2 hours of TV per day.If you drink artificially sweetened or sugar sweetened products.

This injury often occurs along the side of the head where the middle meningeal artery runs in a groove along the temporal bone. This bone is relatively thin and offers less protection than other parts of the skull. As the bleeding continues, the hematoma or clot expands. There is little space in the skull for the hematoma to grow and as it expands, the adjacent brain tissue is compressed. With increased pressure the brain begins to shift and becomes compressed against the bones of the skull. The pressure tends to build quickly because the septae that attach the dura to the skull bones create small spaces that trap blood. Symptoms of head injury and decreased level of consciousness occur as the pressure increases.A subdural hematoma is located beneath the dura mater (sub=below), between it and the arachnoid layer. Blood in this space is able to dissipate into a larger space because there are no septae limiting the blood flow. However, after a period of time, the amount of bleeding may cause increased pressure and cause symptoms similar to those seen with an epidural hematoma.Subarachnoid bleeding occurs in the space beneath the arachnoid layer where the cerebrospinal fluid is located. Often there is intenseandwith subarachnoid bleeding. Because this space connects with the spinal canal, pressure buildup tends not to occur. However, this injury often occurs in combination with the other types of bleeding in the brain and the symptoms may be compounded.Intracerebral bleeding occurs within the brain tissue itself. Sometimes the amount of bleeding is small, but like bruising in any other part of the body, swelling ormay occur over a period of time, causing a progressive decrease in the level of consciousness and other symptoms of head injury.Sometimes, the damage is due to sheer injury, where there is no obvious bleeding in the brain, but instead the nerve fibers within the brain are stretched or torn. Another term for this type of injury is diffuse axonal injury.All injuries to the brain may also cause swelling or edema, no different than the swelling that surrounds a bruise on an arm or leg. However, because the bones of the skull cannot stretch to accommodate the extra volume caused by swelling, the pressure increases inside the skull and causes the brain to compress against the skull.The bones of the skull are classified as flat bones, meaning that they do not have an inside marrow. It takes a significant amount of force to break the skull, and the skull does not absorb any of that impact. It is often transmitted directly to the brain." ,

Organ meats, such as liver, are especially high in cholesterol content, while foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol.After a meal, dietary cholesterol is absorbed from the intestine and stored in the liver.The liver is able to regulate cholesterol levels in the bloodstream and can secrete cholesterol if it is needed by the body.LDL cholesterol(low density lipoprotein) is called bad cholesterol, because elevated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease,, and peripheral artery disease.LDL lipoprotein deposits cholesterol along the inside of artery walls, causing the formation of a hard, thick substance called cholesterol plaque. Over time, cholesterol plaque causes thickening of the artery walls and narrowing of the lumen of the arteries, a process called atherosclerosis, which decreases blood flow through the narrowed plaque-filled vessel.Narrowing of blood vessels in the heart may lead toor heart attack.Narrowing of blood vessels in the brain this may cause a() or.Narrowing of the arteries throughout the body (peripheral artery disease) can lead to signs and symptoms of pain, including in the intestine (mesenteric ischemia) and in the legs with walking (claudication).HDL cholesterol(high density lipoprotein) is called the good cholesterol because HDL cholesterol particles prevent atherosclerosis by extracting cholesterol from the artery walls and disposing of them through the liver.High levels of LDL cholesterol and low levels of HDL cholesterol (high LDL/HDL ratios) are risk factors for atherosclerosis and heart attacksLow levels of LDL cholesterol and high levels of HDL cholesterol (low LDL/HDL ratios) are desirable and protect against heart disease and stroke.Very low and very high HDL cholesterol levels can run in families. Families with low HDL cholesterol levels have a higher incidence of heart attacks than the general population, while families with high HDL cholesterol levels tend to live longer with a lower frequency of heart attacks.Like LDL cholesterol, lifestyle factors, and other conditions influence HDL cholesterol levels. HDL cholesterol levels tend to be lower in persons who smoke cigarettes or have type 2and in those who areor inactive.HDL cholesterol is higher in people who are lean, exercise regularly, and do not smoke cigarettes.Estrogen increases a person's HDL cholesterol, which explains why women generally have higher HDL levels than men.The combination of low levels of total and LDL cholesterol and high levels of HDL cholesterol is favorable.is the sum of LDL (low density) cholesterol, HDL (high density) cholesterol, VLDL (very low-density) cholesterol, and IDL (intermediate density) cholesterol.manufactures and secretes LDL cholesterol into the blood.

"Infant Hydrocele (Hydrocele (Pediatric, Testicular))" : "While hydroceles may occur in either gender, they are much more common in males.A hydrocele is a collection of clear fluid in a thin walled sack present in the scrotum.Hydroceles may be either one sided or occupy both sides.Hydroceles are painless, soft swellings and may be either present at birth (congenital) or develop later.A very large majority of hydroceles present at birth resolve spontaneously by one year of age.Hydroceles that are not congenital or those still present after one year of age may need surgical correction.There are other conditions that must be considered when evaluating a boy with chronic, non-tender scrotal swelling. These include, varicocele and. Physical examination is very helpful in sorting through these options. Rarely are diagnostic or invasive studies necessary." ,
"Infantile Hypercalcemia (Williams Syndrome)" : "Williams syndrome is a disorder in development that usually results in learning problems, attention deficit disorder,, andbut affected individuals have outgoing personalities.Sings and symptoms of Williams syndrome includedistinct facial features (broad forehead, short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, wide mouth with full lips, and dental problems),People with Williams syndrome frequently develop,, and other cardiac and connective tissue related problems and.About 1 in 7,500 to 20,000 people have Williams syndrome.Williams syndrome is caused by deletion of genetic material from chromosome 7; the deleted area includes more than 25 genes and not all may be deleted so individuals may vary in the amount of genetic material deleted.Most people do not inherit Williams syndrome; the deletions in chromosomes are due to random events that occur in eggs or sperm from their parents; the syndrome is autosomal dominant because only one copy of the altered chromosome 7 can cause the disorder.Williams syndrome has many names, for example, Beuren syndrome, Elfin Facies Syndrome, Elfin Facies with hypercalcemia, Hypercalcemia-Supravalvar Aortic Stenosis, Infantile hypercalcemia, Supravalvar aortic stenosis syndrome, WBS, Williams-Beuren Syndrome, WMS, and WS." ,
"Infant Formulas" : "There is an inadequate supply of maternal breast milk.The baby is sucking inefficiently.Parents are unable to quantify the amount of breast milk received by the baby. Some parents want to know exactly how much their baby is receiving at each feeding, and formula/bottle-feeding allows exact measurement.A significant reason for not breastfeeding is concern about transferring certain drugs the mother is taking through the breast milk to the infant. Examples of medications that are considered unsafe for the baby include cimetidine (Tagamet), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), lithium (Lithobid), gold salts, methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), metronidazole (Flagyl), cyclosporine, and bromocriptine (Parlodel).agents are generally also contraindicated. Numerous other medications have not yet been adequately studied in the context of breastfeeding and the possible effects on the baby. Mothers taking medications may choose bottle-feeding rather than risk any potential effect on the baby.An increasing number of mothers must return to work shortly after their baby's delivery. Formula-feeding offers a practical alternative for mothers who may not be able to breastfeed due to work schedules. Formula-fed babies often need to eat less frequently than do breastfed babies because breast milk moves through themore quickly. Thus, breastfed babies may become hungry more frequently.A benefit of bottle-feeding is that the entire family can immediately become intimately involved in all aspects of the baby's care, including feedings. The mother can therefore get more rest, which can be critically important, especially if theand/or delivery were especially difficult." ,

"Infant Drowning (Drowning)" : "Drowning is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ...the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in liquid.Drowning can be classifiedor, depending whether the voice box (larynx) goes into spasm and water is allowed to enter the. Regardless of wet or dry, it does not change the treatment or outcome. The term  drowning used refer to a victim who did not die; however, this term is no longer widely used.Instead, WHO prefers that the type of drowning be classified based on victim outcome:The causes of drowning tend to depend upon the age group of the victim.Factors that can be a significant factor in drowning areAlcohol.from injuries such as a broken neck from diving into too shallow water, which prevents the victim form.Medical emergencies such asDrowning tends to be a quiet, silent act. Victims do not usually thrash. Instead they expend significant energy trying to keep their head above water and may be too tired to shout for help; moreover, if water comes into contact with the vocal cords, they can go into spasm and prevent the victim from shouting for help. Often, the victim is found floating or at the bottom of the body of water or the tub.Drowning is described as a panicked experience. While the victim may appear to be bobbing in the water with their head back, there may be the expression of panic in their eyes.Tips to recognize a person that may be in danger of drowning begin with a reminder that while water is to be enjoyed, it is also a potentially dangerous environment and needs to be treated with respect.Drowning is diagnosed based upon history. The victim is found struggling in the water and most often has difficulty. Any person who has breathing compromised and has been immersed in water can be said to have drowned.Treatment for drowning begins with recognizing that the victim is in trouble, and assessing whether they are awake and breathing. If there has been a traumatic event, like diving into shallow water, the risk of a broken neck should be considered and the neck kept immobilized. If the victim is not breathing on their own or breathing ineffectively, then rescue berating needs to be administered. If there is no heartbeat, then CPR needs to be started. This is the one situation when hands only CPR is not adequate.Drowning victims who arrive in the emergency department awake and breathing on their own have a good prognosis for recovery. Those patients who are not fully awake or who need support breathing have varying recoveries. Prognosis is better if the immersion time is shorter; the water is cleaner and colder. Prognosis also is better for younger individuals compared with the elderly." ,

"Heart: How the Heart Works" : "They begin with the, the large artery leaving the heart. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to all of the body's tissues. They branch several times, becoming smaller and smaller as they carry blood further from the heart and into organs.These are small, thin blood vessels that connect the arteries and the veins. Their thin walls allow oxygen, nutrients, carbon dioxide, and other waste products to pass to and from our organ's cells.These are blood vessels that take blood back to the heart; this blood has lower oxygen content) and is rich in waste products that are to be excreted or removed from the body.

The person develops a change in mental status, becomes confused, lethargic and may have a, the skin stops sweating, and the body temperature may exceed 106 F (41 C). This is a life-threatening condition and emergency medical attention is needed immediately.First aid treatment for heat exhaustion includes recognizing the symptoms, stopping the activity, and moving to a cooler environment. Rehydration with water or a sports drink is the cornerstone of treatment for heat exhaustion.Complications of heat exhaustion include nausea, vomiting,and muscle weakness. If the activity is not stopped and the person left in a hot environment, there can be progression of symptoms to heat stroke, a life threatening emergency.Heat exhaustion can be prevented by being aware of your environment, especially on hot, humid days, and drink lots of fluids (no alcohol or).Infants, children and the elderly are at risk because their bodies are less able to get rid of (dissipate) heat.Infants and children are particularly at risk during hot weather.

"Elevated Calcium (Hyperparathyroidism)" : "Hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by overactivity of the parathyroid glands, four small glands located around the thyroid gland in the neck.Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs when there is a disorder of the parathyroid glands themselves.Secondary hyperparathyroidism results when a condition elsewhere in the body affects the parathyroid glands, causing them to produce too much hormone.Normally, the parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone or PTH, a substance that helps maintain the correct balance of calcium and phosphorus in the body.When blood calcium levels fall too low, the parathyroid glands secrete PTH to restore the blood calcium level.Hyperparathyroidism may or may not cause symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they are often mild, such asIn primary hyperparathyroidism, the elevated levels of PTH cause elevated levels of blood calcium ().Increased calcium and phosphorus excretion in the urine may cause kidney stones.The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a benigncalled an adenoma on one of the parathyroid glands that secretes too much PTH. In other cases, the excess PTH is produced by two or more enlarged parathyroid glands, a condition called hyperplasia.The diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism relies on blood tests to measure hormone and calcium levels.Surgery is the main treatment for hyperparathyroidism." ,

The oxygen attached to a red blood cell is extracted by the tissue, and carbon dioxide (a waste product) is picked up by the now empty red blood cell.The blood, now without oxygen molecules and with higher levels of carbon dioxide, is returned via the veins to the right side of the heart.The blood is then pumped out of the right side of the heart to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide is removed and oxygen, from the air that we breathe, is added to the blood.Now the blood, high in oxygen and low in carbon dioxide, is returned to the left side of the heart where the process starts all over again.The blood travels in a circle and is therefore referred to as circulation.Oxygen is carried within the red blood cell by a molecule known as hemoglobin. When this combination of oxygen and hemoglobin occurs, the oxygen-carrying blood turns brighter red. This blood oxygen saturation can be measured, either by sampling the blood from an artery or by a noninvasive device called an oximeter that can be placed on a finger or earlobe.Oxygen saturation in a healthy individual approaches 100% at sea level.fatfrom a broken thigh bone (femur),anembolus in, andin some cases,tissue from." ,

"Emergency Hurricane Preparedness (Hurricane Preparedness)" : "The definition of a hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone (a circulating weather system) over Atlantic and northeastern Pacific tropical waters that has well-defined circulation, and sustained winds of 74 mph or higher. These same types of storms are called typhoons in the western Pacific, and cyclones in the Indian Ocean.All Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastal areas are subject to hurricanes. An reliable estimate of expected annual property loss due to hurricanes is $5 billion.The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June to November, with the peak season from min-August to late October. People living in these areas need to prepare for these events.Hurricanes are categorized according to wind speeds based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, from 1 to 5.In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf coast as a Category 3 storm, with sustained winds up to 140 mph. Katrina was the costliest natural disaster in the U.S, and the third-most deadly, with 1,245 deaths related to the storm. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy was a Category 3 storm when it made landfall in Cuba, and by the time it reached the northeastern U.S. where it made landfall, it was a Category 1 with winds of 80 mph. It was the second-costliest hurricane in U.S history. In October 2016 Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the Caribbean and the southeastern U.S. Matthew was a Category 4 storm when it hit Haiti with 145 mph winds. It briefly strengthened to a Category 5 out at sea before making its way over the Bahamas as a Category 3, and hitting the U.S. mainland in just north of Charleston, SC as a Category 1 with wind gusts up to 75 mph.The National Hurricane Center (NHC), a division of The U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), predicts, names, and tracks tropical weather systems.The National Hurricane Center suggests having a family disaster plan that is written down and discussed with all family members before a storm approaches. Create a checklist for all the things you will need to do in the event of an approaching storm. Include pets in your plans.Part of your hurricane preparedness plan should include where to go in the event you need to evacuate your home. Follow instructions of local authorities and evacuate if required.Secure your home, and make sure you have enough supplies for several days in case you lose power or cannot get out of the area due to floods or blocked roads.Take locally offered or Internet based, CPR, and disaster preparedness classes.After the storm, make sure food and water is safe to eat and drink.

It is one of the most common (1 in 2,500 people) inherited neurological disorders. CMT is also known as HMSM (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy) and peroneal muscular atrophy.Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease often begin in adolescence or early adulthood (some may occur early in life) and may include difficulty withThe cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is inherited mutations in genes (also termed a hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy) that produce proteins that are involved in the structure of peripheral nervous system, specifically, axons or their myelin sheaths (myelin insulates and protects nerve cells); infrequently, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease can occur with spontaneous mutation of the person's gene.There are many forms of CMT (for example, CMT 1-4, CMTX, or type 1 or type 2); these forms or types are related to the mutations in the genes that alter the peripheral nerves and/or their myelin sheaths.Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is diagnosed with the patient's medical history, family history, and neurological examination. The physical examination may revealCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease has no cure, but individuals may be helped (treated) with, stretching, plus physical and occupational therapy. Many patients may benefit from use of orthopedic items, such as ankleand other items (thumb splints to help hand weakness), to give support so the patient maintains mobility.The majority of patients have a normal life span, but a few do not and experience severe progressive disease.Diagnosis is done by the patient's family history, their physical exam, and symptoms; other tests may include nerve conduction studies, electromyography, or nerve biopsy to help distinguish CMT from other diseases like muscular dystrophies.The prognosis (outcome) varies with the disease severity and usually ranges from fair to poor, as the disease is progressive.Research is ongoing for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and includes gene therapy experiments, the use of nerve growth factors, vitamin C, and the use of curcumin (a component of curry) in animal models of this disease.A list of government and private organizations that can provide more detailed information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and research on Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is provided in this article." ,

"Disease, Marfan (Marfan Syndrome)" : "Marfan syndrome is a disease of connective tissues that is.The severity of Marfan syndrome varies from one individual to another and it typically progresses over time.A tall, slender build is characteristic of Marfan syndrome.Marfan syndrome affects the skeleton, eyes, heart and blood vessels, nervous system, skin, and respiratory system.Marfan syndrome can cause dislocation of theof the eye and detachment of the retina, resulting in vision loss in patients with the condition.The child of a patient with Marfan syndrome has a 50% chance of have the disease.is common in patients with Marfan syndrome.Abnormal aortic dilation () can be a serious manifestation of Marfan syndrome.The syndrome is caused by a defect, or mutation, in the gene that determines the structure of fibrillin-1, a protein that is an important part of connective tissue.There is no specific laboratory test, such as a blood test or, to diagnose Marfan syndrome. The doctor and/or geneticist (a doctor with special knowledge about inherited diseases) relies on observation and a complete medical history and examination.There is no cure for Marfan syndrome. However, a range of treatment options are designed to minimize and prevent complications.People with the syndrome are typically very tall, slender, and loose-jointed. Because Marfan syndrome affects the long bones of the skeleton, a person's arms, legs, fingers, and toes may be disproportionately long in relation to the rest of the body. A person with the syndrome often has a long, narrow face, and the roof of the mouth may be arched, causing theto be crowded. Other skeletal problems include a sternum (breastbone) that is either protruding or indented, curvature of the spine (), and flat.More than half of all people with the condition experience dislocation of one or both lenses of the eye. The lens may be slightly higher or lower than normal, and may be shifted off to one side. The dislocation may be minimal, or it may be pronounced and obvious. One serious complication that may occur with this disorder is. Many people with the condition are also nearsighted (myopic), and some can develop early(high pressure within the eye) or(the eye's lens loses its clearness).Marfan syndrome patients have problems associated with the heart and blood vessels. Because of faulty connective tissue, the wall of the(the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body) may be weakened and stretch, a process called aortic dilatation. Aortic dilatation increases the risk that the aorta will tear () or rupture, causing serious heart problems or sometimes sudden death. Sometimes, defects in heart valves can also cause problems. In some cases, certain valves may leak, creating a , which a doctor can hear with a stethoscope. Small leaks may not result in any symptoms, but larger ones may cause shortness of breath,, and(a very fast or irregular heart rate).The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by fluid contained by a membrane called the dura, which is composed of connective tissue. Marfan syndrome patients grow older, the dura often weakens and stretches, then begins to weigh on the vertebrae in the lower spine and wear away the bone surrounding the spinal cord. This is called dural ectasia. These changes may cause only mild discomfort; or they may lead to radiatedin the abdomen; or to, numbness, or weakness in the legs.Many people with Marfan syndrome developon their skin, even without any weight change. Thesecan occur at any age and pose no health risk. However, people with Marfan syndrome are also at increased risk for developing an abdominal or inguinal, in which a bulge develops that contains part of the.Although connective tissue problems make the tiny air sacs within the lungs less elastic, people with Marfan syndrome generally do not experience noticeable problems with their lungs. If, however, these tiny air sacs become stretched or swollen, the risk ofmay increase.

Readers should note that flaviviruses are not the same as filoviruses, as these two viral terms designate two different families of viruses and are easily confused; Ebola is caused by a filovirus, not a flavivirus.Hemorrhagic fever viruses are mainly zoonotic diseases caused by viruses that usually reside in an animal or arthropod hosts that may serve as health vectors.Viral hemorrhagic fevers are usually seen associated with only one particular of species and consequently are usually contained in geographically restricted areas in Liberia, Uganda, Bolivia, or other countries with such areas; however, if the virus is introduced accidentally to humans in cities, it may become widespread (for example, the recent Ebola outbreak).Hemorrhagic fever viruses are usually transmitted among animal or arthropod hosts; however, the viruses carried in these animal or arthropods can be transmitted to humans when humans come in contact with the urine, feces, saliva, or other bodily fluids of infected animals or arthropods, including if the animal is killed and eaten. In some instances, once the viruses infect humans, person-to-person transmission can occur when an uninfected person comes in contact with bodily fluids or (with some viruses) a bite by an arthropod vector.Symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever include,, weakness,, and muscle aches; patients with more severe infections show bleeding under the skin, internal organs, or even from bodily orifices like the mouth, eyes, or ears. Some patients develop severethat may also be bloody, and severely ill patients present with, delirium,,, andthat often ends in death.Patients with viral hemorrhagic fevers usually receive only supportive therapy; there is no other established cure for viral hemorrhagic fevers. However, ribavirin (Rebetol, Copegus) medical treatment has been effective in treating some individuals with Lassa fever, and treatment with convalescent-phase plasma has been used with success in a few patients -- other experimental antiviral agents have also been tried in a few patients.Prevention and control of hemorrhagic fevers is difficult; except for yellow fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever, nohave been made commercially available so that prevention efforts are concentrated on avoiding contacts with the host species, vectors, or humans infected with the viruses although one recent clinical trial showed effectiveness of aagainst a strain of.Scientists and health researchers are addressing the threat of viral hemorrhagic fevers to humans by attempting to develop immunological, molecular, and containment methods to prevent these hemorrhagic fevers and restore health to individuals who get hemorrhagic fevers.They are all RNA viruses, and all are covered, or enveloped, in a fatty () coating.Their survival is dependent on an animal or insect host, called the natural reservoir.The viruses are geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live.Humans are not the natural reservoir for any of these viruses. Humans are infected when they come into contact with infected hosts. However, with some viruses, after the accidental transmission from the host, humans can transmit the virus to one another.Human cases or outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers caused by these viruses occur sporadically and irregularly. The occurrence of outbreaks cannot be easily predicted.With a few noteworthy exceptions, there is no cure or established drug treatment for VHFs." ,

"Borderline Personality Disorder" : "Borderline personality disorder is a personality disorder of emotional dysregulation that involves the sufferer consistently exhibiting abnormal self-image, ways of feeling and interacting, leading to difficulties with interpersonal relationships.BPD affects men as often as women in general and women more than men in treatment populations.Antisocial behavior in adults, substance-abuse problems in men,in women, and anxious and odd personality disorders in adolescents tend to co-occur with BPD.There has been some controversy about whether or not BPD is its own disorder or a variation of.Like most other mental disorders, borderline personality disorder is understood to be the result of a combination of biological vulnerabilities, ways of thinking, and social stressors (biopsychosocial model).BPD sufferers are more likely to have a learning problem or certain temperaments as children, or come from families of origin where divorce, neglect, sexual abuse,, or death occurred.To be diagnosed with BPD, the sufferer must experience at least five of the following symptoms: unstable self-image, relationships or emotions, severe impulsivity that results in engaging in risky behaviors, repeated suicidal behaviors or threats, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate anger, trouble with anger management, or transient paranoia or dissociation.As with other mental disorders, there is no specific definitive test, like an X-ray, to diagnose BPD. Therefore, mental-health professionals conduct a mental-health interview that looks for the presence of the previously described symptoms and often explore the person's history of any medical problem or other emotional problem that may share symptoms of the disorder.approaches that have been helpful in treating BPD include dialectical, cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, and psychoanalytic psychotherapy.The use of psychiatric medications like antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics may be useful in addressing some of the symptoms of BPD but do not entirely manage the illness.Partial hospitalization can help treat BPD by providing frequent supervision and assessment in a safe environment, while allowing the sufferer to go home each day.The presence of BPD tends to worsen the overall emotional instability and other symptoms of other mental illnesses and increase the risk for self-mutilation, as well as for attempting or completing.People with BPD are at somewhat higher risk for engaging in violent behavior. That risk is further increased when the individual with BPD also is suffering from, has a previous history of violent behavior, frequently uses sedative medications, or experiences several changes in their psychiatric medications.Although the symptoms of BPD tend to diminish over years for many people, how well or poorly people with BPD progress over time seems to be influenced by the severity of the symptoms, the person's current relationships, whether or not the sufferer has a history of being a victim of, as well as whether or not the individual receives appropriate treatment.Steady employment or school enrollment once symptoms of BPD subside (remit) tends to protect BPD sufferers from experiencing a relapse." ,

"Home Pregnancy Tests (Pregnancy Test)" : "Pregnancy tests work by detecting a hormone in a woman's blood or urine: hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is produced when an egg implanted in the uterus.There are two types of pregnancy tests, one uses blood and the other uses urine (home tests); a quantitative blood test detects hCG earlier than a qualitative blood or urine test.Most home pregnancy tests detect hCG in a urine stream when, after a few minutes, a line or symbol appears if the test is positive (indicating pregnancy); most urine pregnancy test instructions urge a second test in a few days no matter what were the first results; follow package instructions  if a control indicator does not appear, the test result should not be trusted.Home tests are accurate, some better (more sensitive in showing early pregnancy) than others.Home pregnancy tests may test positive on the first day of a missed period, but almost all detect pregnancy 1 week after a missed period.Call your doctor for an appointment if you test positive for pregnancy with a home test.It is possible to beand have a negative home pregnancy test; that is why you should wait about a week to repeat the test.Most medicines and other compounds (alcohol, drugs) do not interfere with pregnancy tests; however, any drug containing hCG (somedrugs) may give false test results.Any questions or problems with pregnancy tests should be discussed with your doctor." ,
"HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV))" : "The human immunodeficiency virus () is a type of virus called a retrovirus, which can infect humans when it comes in contact with tissues that line the vagina, anal area, mouth, or eyes, or through a break in the skin.infection is generally a slowly progressive disease in which the virus is present throughout the body at all stages of the disease.Three stages of HIV infection have been described.When HIV grows (that is, by reproducing itself), it acquires the ability to change (mutate) its own structure. These mutations enable the virus to become resistant to previously effective drug therapy.The goals of drug therapy are to prevent damage to the immune system by the HIV virus and to halt or delay the progress of the infection to symptomatic disease.Therapy for HIV includes combinations of drugs that decrease the growth of the virus to such an extent that the treatment prevents or markedly delays the development of viral resistance to the drugs.The best combination of drugs for HIV are those that effectively suppress viral replication in the blood and also are well tolerated and simple to take so that people can take the medications consistently without missing doses." ,

Both surgeries are done mainly to improve airflow or improve sinus drainage but may have other purposes such ascontrol.There are risks and complications for all surgeries; those for deviated septum and turbinate surgeries are infrequent, but include the following:Prior to undergoing these surgical procedures, the patient needs to obtain instructions from their doctors (surgeon and anesthesiologist) in regard to preparing for the surgical procedure (for example, what medications to stop taking prior to surgery, when the last meals ormay be consumed prior to surgery).Deviated septum surgery and turbinate surgery last approximately an hour, and the patient is closely monitored because they usually will be under general anesthesia. Complications rarely occur, and the patient usually can go home the same day as the surgery.After surgery, the patient will need someone to transport the them home. To avoid nose bleeding, it is important for the patient to keep their head elevated, and to avoid any straining during bowel movements or. Some mild swelling of the face and nose may occur but is not common, and ice packs can help reduce this swelling (a bag of frozen peas or corn will easily conform to the face, and may provide the most comfort).Following the doctor's instructions in regard to surgery after-care is very important, and the success of the surgery may depend on this surgery after-care. Patients will be instructed about nasal packing, nasal packing removal, necessary follow-up examinations, and the importance of the use ofto reduce nasal crusting or scab formation. The surgical site will be very sensitive to normal activity such as lifting objects, wearing glasses, bending over, nasal congestion, and other activities, thus, theses situations should be avoided if possible.If a patient experiences a sudden increase in nose bleeding, agreater than 101.5 F (38.6 C), persistent sharp, or increased swelling after surgery, they should contact their surgeon immediately." ,

"NDM-1" : "NDM-1 stands for a gene that producesin certain bacteria that cause infections. This is a substance that destroys the commonest types of antibiotics.Bacteria with the NDM-1 gene are part of a larger group ofbacteria that are extremely hard to treat and can spread easily in hospitals. Most NDM-1 strains are resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.Specific testing for NDM-1 is not routinely available.NDM-1 has been reported most commonly from India and Pakistan. It is spreading throughout the world as people travel from country to country.The first three cases of NDM-1 in the United States were reported in June 2010.NDM-1 is carried by bacteria that commonly inhabit the bowel. Strains spread from person to person through contact with contaminated hands or items.Washing or disinfecting hands frequently and wearing protective clothing in hospitals lowers the risk of spreading or getting NDM-1. In hospitals, hand hygiene is critical. Patients with NDM-1 are also placed in private rooms, and health-care workers wear gowns and gloves when entering.To reduce the risk of resistant bacteria, doctors and hospitals must use antibiotics wisely and only when needed.Bacteria that express NDM-1 usually have other resistance factors, such as carbapenemases. Thus, most NDM-1 strains are resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.Routine antibiotic-sensitivity testing can detect resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Specific testing for NDM-1 is not routinely available. Fortunately, it is not necessary to determine if carbapenem resistance is specifically due to NDM-1 because treatment is guided by the antibiotic-sensitivity testing." ,

In general, thymic tumors are uncommon.The thymus gland is present in the front of the space between thecalled the anterior mediastinum and behind the upper sternum. The thymus gland is larger during, but then normally becomes smaller in adulthood.Thymomas are most frequently seen in people in the fourth and fifth decades of life.There are no known risk factors that predispose a person to developing a thymoma.Up to half of thymomas are asymptomatic, meaning they do not produce any symptoms or signs and are diagnosed when an imaging study of the chest is performed for another reason., shortness of breath, andare common symptoms that patients experience when symptoms do occur.Many patients with thymoma will have a so-called paraneoplastic syndrome. A paraneoplastic syndrome occurs preceding or concurrent with the discovery of a thymoma. These conditions accompany the's development but are not a direct result of the disease as a lump ormight be. They seem to be an indirect result of theand may or may not improve with the treatment of the underlying disease. The most commonly associated condition with thymoma is, a disease of muscle. Twenty percent of patients with myasthenia gravis will be found to have a thymoma.Thymomas are slow-growing tumors, and the prognosis is excellent when they are discovered in their early stages. Five-year survival for thymoma patients receiving modern treatment approaches 80%. Patients with the more rare form of the disease called thymic carcinomas have a more aggressive disease with five-year survival even with treatment of only about 40% on average.Surgical removal is the mainstay of treatment.andmay be used in cases in which surgical treatment is not effective in removing the entire tumor or in particularly aggressive cases." ,

"Brucellosis Facts" : "Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria termed; the disease is found mainly in animals (zoonotic infection), but humans can be infected with these bacteria.Brucellosis has been described as long as 2,000 years ago, and the organisms finally were identified in 1887; the disease is worldwide and usually confined to animals. Because the bacteria can be aerosolized, it has been designated as a potential biologic weapon.Brucellosis is caused bystrains that can infect humans throughin the skin, through mucous membranes, byand by eating contaminated meat or other animal-derived foods; the bacteria can survive inside human cells and spread to many different organs.Risk factors include drinking unpasteurized milk, eating unpasteurized cheese, and close association with animals (farmers, veterinarians) and with hunters and meat processors.Brucellosis is spread to humans by milk, meat, or cheese that is obtained from infected animals; human person-to-person spread is very rare.Early symptoms of brucellosis include,,, pain in the muscles and joints, pain in the back, and/or loss of appetite; over time, fevers may become recurrent, organ damage may occur (organ swelling), and skin changes such as rashes and/or micro-abscesses may form.Brucellosis is preliminarily diagnosed by the patient's history and physical exam and definitively diagnosed by culturing bacteria from the patient. Blood tests are also available to show antibodies to the infection.Treatment is usually done with a combination of doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox) and rifampin (Rifadin) for an extended period (about six to eight weeks).The prognosis of brucellosis that is treated early and effectively is very good; however, if the disease progresses to cause organ damage, the prognosis worsens.Prevention of brucellosis is possible by avoiding contact with infected animals and utilizing pasteurized milk and cheese products; if contact is necessary, wearing gloves and a facemask may reduce the chance of getting brucellosis.A vaccine is available for animals to protect them from brucellosis; there is no vaccine available for humans." ,

"Club Drugs" : "GHB (Xyrem) is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 for use in the treatment of(adisorder). This approval came with severe restrictions, including its use only for the treatment of narcolepsy, and the requirement for a patient registry monitored by the FDA. GHB is also a metabolite of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It exists naturally in the brain, but at much lower concentrations than those found when GHB is abused.Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) use began gaining popularity in the United States in the early 1990s. It is a benzodiazepine (chemically similar to sedative-hypnotic drugs such asValium or Xanax), but it is not approved for medical use in this country, and its importation is banned.Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic, mostly used in veterinary practice.GHB and Rohypnol are available in odorless, colorless, and tasteless forms that are frequently combined with alcohol and other. Both drugs have been used to commit sexual assaults (also known as , drug, acquaintance rape, or drug-assisted assault) due to their ability to sedate and incapacitate unsuspecting victims, preventing them from resisting sexual assault.GHB is usually ingested orally, either in liquid or powder form, while Rohypnol is typically taken orally in pill form. Recent reports, however, have shown that Rohypnol is being ground up and snorted.Both GHB and Rohypnol are also abused for their intoxicating effects, similar to other CNS depressants.GHB also has anabolic effects (it stimulates protein synthesis) and has been used by bodybuilders to aid in fat reduction and muscle building.Ketamine is usually snorted or injected intramuscularly.GHB acts on at least two sites in the brain: the GABAB receptor and a specific GHB binding site. At high doses, GHB's sedative effects may result in,, or death.Rohypnol, like other benzodiazepines, acts at the GABAA receptor. It can produce anterograde, in which individuals may not remember events they experienced while under the influence of the drug.Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic, so called because it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. Ketamine acts on a type of glutamate receptor (NMDA receptor) to produce its effects, which are similar to those of the drug PCP. Low-dose intoxication results in impaired attention, learning ability, and memory. At higher doses, ketamine can cause dreamlike states and hallucinations; and at higher doses still, ketamine can cause delirium and amnesia." ,

"Cocaine and Crack Abuse" : "Cocaine, also called, nose candy, snow, blow, or toot, is a drug that comes from the coca plant. Crack cocaine, also called rock or rock cocaine, is cocaine in solid form.About 25 million people in the United States use cocaine at least once during their lifetime.Symptoms of cocaine intoxication include intense euphoria and pleasure followed by the person becoming hyperactive and hyperalert.Once the high associated with cocaine intoxication wears off, the individual tends to become agitated, irritable, and physically uncomfortable.Cocaine intoxication often dramatically increases the release of the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.Cocaine abuse andis one of a number of stimulant-use disorders and has no single cause but is rather due to the combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.Withdrawal symptoms and signs for cocaine include irritability, decreased appetite,, and craving the drug.Symptoms of cocaine-use disorder include recurring use of large amounts of the substance over long periods of time, craving the substance, needing more drug to achieve intoxication over time, symptoms of withdrawing from the substance, drug use that interferes with important obligations, and trouble refraining from using cocaine. People who have cocaine use disorder are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors and experience their consequences, as well as having an increased risk of, homicide,, and other forms of violence.Medical risks of cocaine use disorder, particularly when in crack form, include tearing of the major artery in the body () orassociated with very. It is also a risk factor for.For children exposed to cocaine in utero, the difficulties it can cause have been detected as early as during infancy.Since there is no one specific test that definitively determines that someone has cocaine-use disorder, health-care professionals diagnose this disorder by gathering comprehensive medical, family, andinformation, as well as securing a physical examination and lab tests to evaluate the sufferer's medical state.Treatment services for cocaine use disorder remains largely unutilized by most sufferers of this illness.The major goals for recovery are abstinence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation.During the initial stage of abstinence, a person with cocaine or other substance use disorder may need detoxification to prevent or decrease the effects of withdrawal.For many people with chemical dependency, much more difficult and time-consuming than recovery from the physical symptoms of cocaine-use disorder is psychological addiction.The treatment of dual diagnosis (the combination of a substance-use disorder and another mental-health disorder) seems to be more effective when treatment of the individual'sis coordinated with addressing the individual's chemical dependency.Recovery from cocaine-use disorder usually includes episodes of remission and relapse." ,

"Rape (Sexual Assault)" : "Sexual assault is any illegal sexual contact that involves forcing a person without their consent or inflicting such contact with someone who is unable to give consent due to age or physical or mental capabilities.Sexual assault may also involve sexual contact that is inflicted by someone who is trusted by or has authority over the victim.Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual behavior that interferes with the victim's work or school life.Sexual battery refers to contact with an intimate body part of another person that is unwantedby the victim and is done in order for the perpetrator to achieve sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse.Any sexual assault that involves inflicting physical injury or maiming of the victim is described as being aggravated sexual assault.Rape is unlawful sexual activity involving sexual intercourse that happens by force or under the threat of some form of harm.Rape occurs in a variety of contexts, as in childhood marriage, as a form of torture and is sometimes perpetrated by members of the military on their own colleagues.States tend to legally define first-, second-, and third-degree rape and sexual assault based on the age of the victim and the perpetrator, and/or the amount of force, brutality, and threat inflicted on the victim.Unfortunately, rape is grossly underreported to law enforcement.A majority of victims of sexual victimization indicate that the perpetrator is known to them, like an acquaintance as in, or by a family member or friend.Signs and symptoms of someone who has been sexually assaulted or raped tend to include a variety of emotional, behavioral, social, and work-related problems.Some ways to prevent sexual assault and rape are to lessen the life risk factors for being the victim or perpetrator of these crimes.If left untreated, the physical and psychological effects of sexual assault and rape can be devastating, sometimes even deadly.The primary consideration for caring for victims of rape or other sexual assault is to focus on the needs of the victim during this crisis, providing timely, appropriate medical, mental-health, and legal assessment and care by specially trained and experienced professionals in a timely manner." ,
"Pacemaker" : "A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control. This device uses low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.Pacemakers are used to treat arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.Pacemakers can relieve some arrhythmia symptoms, such as() and. A pacemaker also can help a person who has abnormal heart rhythms resume a more active lifestyle.Doctors also treat arrhythmias with implantabledefibrillators (ICDs). ICDs are similar to pacemakers. However, besides using low-energy electrical pulses to control abnormal heart rhythms, ICDs also can use high-energy electrical pulses to treat certain dangerous arrhythmias.Doctors recommend pacemakers for a number of reasons. The most common reasons are bradycardia and. Bradycardia is a slower than normal heartbeat. Heart block is a problem that occurs with the heart's electrical system. The disorder occurs when an electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart.Before recommending a pacemaker, your doctor will consider any arrhythmia symptoms you have, such as, unexplained fainting, or shortness of breath. He or she also will consider whether you have a history of, what medicines you're currently taking, and the results of heart tests.A pacemaker consists of a battery, a computerized generator, and wires with sensors called electrodes on one end. The electrodes detect your heart's electrical activity and send data through the wires to the computer in the generator.If your heart rhythm is abnormal, the computer will direct the generator to send electrical pulses to your heart. The pulses then travel through the wires to reach your heart.Newer pacemakers also can monitor your blood temperature,, and other factors and adjust your heart rate to changes in your activity.Placing a pacemaker requires minor surgery. The surgery usually is done in a hospital or special heart treatment laboratory. You'll be given medicine just before the surgery that will help you relax and may make you sleepy.The surgery takes just a few hours, but you'll stay in the hospital overnight so your health care team can check your heartbeat and make sure your pacemaker is working properly.Complications from pacemaker surgery are rare. Most people can return to their normal activities within a few days.Your doctor may ask you to avoid vigorousor heavy lifting for about a month after your surgery. After you have fully recovered from surgery, discuss with your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.Once you have a pacemaker, you have to avoid close or prolonged contact with electrical devices or devices that have strong magnetic fields. You also need to avoid certain medical procedures that can disrupt your pacemaker.Let all of your doctors, dentists, and medical technicians know that you have a pacemaker. Your doctor can give you a card that states what kind of pacemaker you have. Carry this card in your wallet. You may want to consider wearing a medical ID bracelet or necklace that explains that you have a pacemaker.Your doctor will want to check your pacemaker regularly. Some pacemaker functions can be checked remotely through a telephone call or a computer connection to the Internet. Your doctor may ask you to come to his or her office to check your pacemaker.Pacemaker batteries last between 5 and 15 years (average 6 to 7 years), depending on how active your pacemaker is.

Girls, women, and ethnic minorities develop PTSD more than boys, men, and Caucasians.Complex posttraumaticdisorder (C-PTSD) usually results from prolonged exposure to traumatic event(s) and is characterized by long-lasting problems that affect many aspects of emotional and social functioning.Symptoms of C-PTSD include problems regulating feelings, dissociation, or depersonalization, persistent depressive feelings, seeing the perpetrator of trauma as all powerful, preoccupation with the perpetrator, and a severe change in what gives the sufferer meaning.Untreated PTSD can have devastating, far-reaching consequences for sufferers' medical, emotional, and vocational functioning and relationships, their families, and for society. Children with PTSD can experience significantly negative effects on their social and emotional development, as well as their ability to learn.Although almost any event that is life threatening or that severely compromises the emotional well-being of an individual may cause PTSD, such events usually include experiencing or witnessing a severe accident or physical injury, getting a frightening medical diagnosis, being the victim of a crime or torture, exposure to combat, disaster, or terrorist attack, enduring any form of abuse, or involvement in civil conflict.Issues that tend to put people at higher risk for developing PTSD include female gender, minority status, increased duration or severity of, as well as exposure to, the trauma experienced, having an emotional condition prior to the event, and having little social support. Risk factors for children and adolescents also include having anyor experiencing violence in the home.Disaster preparedness training may be a protective factor for PTSD as can rapid intervention and certain personal, interpersonal, and environmental factors.Medicines that treat(for example, serotonergic antidepressants or SSRIs) or that decrease the heart rate (for example, propranolol) are thought to be effective tools in theof PTSD when given in the days immediately after an individual experiences a traumatic event.SSRIs seem to be most effective in treating people whose PTSD is the result of noncombat-related trauma.Individuals who wonder if they may be suffering from PTSD may benefit from taking a self-test as they consider meeting with a health-care professional. Professionals may use a clinical interview in adults, children, or adolescents, or one of a number of structured tests with children or adolescents to assess for the presence of this illness.Diagnosing PTSD can present a challenge for professionals since sufferers often come for evaluation of something that seems to be unrelated to that illness at first.

Education about the illness, helping the individual talk about the trauma directly, exploration and modification of inaccurate ways of thinking about it, and teaching the person ways to manage symptoms and are the usual techniques used in. Family and couples' counseling,classes, and education about conflict resolution are other useful psychotherapeutic interventions.Directly addressing thethat are associated with PTSD has been found to help alleviate those problems, thereby decreasing the symptoms of PTSD in general.Medications that are usually used to help PTSD sufferers include serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) and medicines that help decrease the physical symptoms associated with illness. Other potentially helpful medications for managing PTSD include mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Tranquilizers have been associated with withdrawal symptoms and other problems and have not been found to be significantly effective for helping individuals with PTSD.Some ways that are often suggested for PTSD patients to cope with this illness include learning more about the illness, occupational therapy including service dog therapy, talking to others for support, using relaxation techniques, participating in treatment, increasing positive lifestyle practices, and minimizing negative lifestyle practices." ,

This occurs after hormone levels drop at the end of the previous cycle, signaling blood and tissues lining the uterus (womb) to break down and shed from the body. Bleeding lasts about 5 days.Usually by, bleeding has stopped. Leading up to this time, hormones cause fluid-filled pockets called follicles to develop on the ovaries. Each follicle contains an egg.Between, one follicle will continue to develop and reach maturity. The lining of the uterus starts to thicken, waiting for a fertilized egg to implant there. The lining is rich in blood and nutrients.Around(in a 28-day cycle), hormones cause the mature follicle to burst and release an egg from the ovary, a process called ovulation.Over the next few days, the egg travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. If a sperm unites with the egg here, the fertilized egg will continue down the fallopian tube and attach to the lining of the uterus.If the egg is not fertilized, hormone levels will drop around. This signals the next menstrual cycle to begin. The egg will break apart and be shed with the next period." ,

"PBC Treatment (Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Treatment (PBC))" : "is a chronic disease characterized by progressive inflammation and destruction of small bile ducts within the. The bile ducts transport bile from the liver to the intestine for the absorption of fat and elimination of waste products.A disease of adults, PBC affects women more often than men.The cause of PBC may involve autoimmunity, infection, or genetic predisposition, acting alone or in combination. The finding of autoantibodies called(AMA) in most patients with PBC favors the concept of an autoimmune disease occurring in genetically predisposed individuals.The symptoms and physical findings in patients with PBC can be divided into those due to the PBC itself, the complications ofin PBC, and the diseases associated with PBC.The risk of developing PBC is significantly greater for people who have had other autoimmune diseases, smoked cigarettes, had aas a child, or for women who have had urinary tract or vaginal infections.The criteria for a definitive diagnosis of PBC include the presence of cholestatic, a positive AMA with a titer equal to or greater than 1:40, and aconsistent with the diagnosis.The natural history of untreated PBC extends for decades and goes through four phases. Sequentially, there is a pre-clinical phase with a positive AMA in the absence of liver blood test abnormalities or symptoms, an asymptomatic phase when liver tests become abnormal, a symptomatic phase, and an advanced phase with the complications of cirrhosis.The outcome (prognosis) of individual patients can be estimated using a mathematical equation to calculate a Mayo risk score.occurs infrequently in women with PBC, but mostwith PBC have delivered normal. The chance that treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid during pregnancy will cause fetal harm is remote but possible.Medications used to treat PBC itself include most commonly ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), rarely colchicine (Colcrys), and sometimes certain immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids. The UDCA is the most effective and safe treatment. In May 2016, the FDA approved another drug, obeticholic acid (Ocaliva) for the treatment of PBC.Symptoms of PBC that can be treated includeComplications of cirrhosis in PCB that can be treated includeDiseases associated with PBC that can be treated includePBC patients with advanced complications of cirrhosis, severe, or intractable itching are eligible for liver transplantation. The results of liver transplantation are excellent in patients with PBC.The goal of research in PBC is to better understand the ways in which the inflammation that destroys small bile ducts and later produces cirrhosis is initiated and perpetuated.

The openings where the ureters empty urine into the bladder should work like valves to keep urine from backing up into the ureters. Sometimes the valve doesn't work properly and urine flows back into the kidneys. The urine may flow only a short way back into the ureters, or it may go all the way back to the kidneys, causing the ureters and kidneys to swell. VUR may occur in only one ureter or in both. Kidneys with severe reflux may not develop normally, and after birth kidneys with reflux may be at risk for damage from infections.. The point where the ureter joins the kidney is called the ureteropelvic junction. If urine is blocked here, only the kidney swells. The ureter remains at a normal size. UPJ obstruction usually only occurs in one kidney.. BOO describes any blockage in the urethra or at the opening of the bladder. The obstruction may occur in boys or girls. The most common form of BOO seen in newborns and duringexaminations is posterior urethral valves (PUV). BOO caused by PUV occurs only in boys.. In boys, sometimes an abnormal fold of tissue in the urethra keeps urine from flowing freely out of the bladder. This defect may cause swelling in the entire urinary tract, including the urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys.. If the end of the ureter does not develop normally, it can bulge, creating what is called a ureterocele. The ureterocele may obstruct part of the kidney or the bladder..

As discussed later, it appears that genetic and other biological factors produce a vulnerability to schizophrenia, with environmental factors contributing to different degrees in different individuals.There are a number of various schizophrenia treatments. Given the complexity of this disorder, the major questions about the illness (its cause or causes, prevention, and treatment) are unlikely to be resolved in the near future. The public should beware of those offering the cure for (or the cause of) schizophrenia.Schizophrenia is one of the psychotic, also called thought-disordered, mental disorders and affects a person's thoughts, behaviors, and social functioning.Symptoms of schizophrenia may includeWhile schizophrenia used to be divided into different types of the disorder, like paranoid and undifferentiated forms, it is now considered to have various symptoms of one inclusive disorder.Children as young as 6 years of age can be found to have all the schizophrenia symptoms as their adult counterparts and to continue to have those symptoms into adulthood.Although the termhas only been in used since 1911, its symptoms have been described throughout written history.Schizophrenia is considered to be the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental risk factors.Health-care professionals diagnose schizophrenia by gathering comprehensive medical, family, mental-health, and social/cultural information.The practitioner will also either perform a physical examination or request that the person's primary-care doctor perform one. The medical evaluation will usually include lab tests.In addition to providing treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis, practitioners attempt to determine the presence of other mental illnesses that may co-occur with schizophrenia.People with schizophrenia are at increased risk of having a number of medical problems, other mental-health conditions, committingor engaging in other self-harm, and otherwise dying earlier than people without this disorder.Medications that have been found to be most effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are first- and second-generation antipsychotics.Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia include education of family members, assertive community treatment (ACT), substance-abuse treatment, social-skills training, supported employment, cognitive behavioral therapy, and.Cognitive remediation, peer-to-peer interventions, weight-management therapies, and continued medication refinement remain the focus topics for research." ,

"Mental Illness" : " : Many mental illnesses run in families, suggesting they may be passed on from parents to children through genes. Genes contain instructions for the function of each cell in the body and are responsible for how we look, act, think, etc. However, just because your mother or father may have or had a mental illness doesn't mean you will have one. Hereditary just means that you are more likely to get the condition than if you didn't have an affected family member. Experts believe that many mental conditions are linked to problems in multiple genes -- not just one, as with many diseases -- which is why a person inherits a susceptibility to a mental disorder but doesn't always develop the condition. The disorder itself occurs from the interaction of these genes and other factors -- such as psychologicaland environmental stressors -- which can influence, or trigger, the illness in a person who has inherited a susceptibility to it.: Some mental illnesses have been linked to an abnormal balance of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters help nerve cells in the brain communicate with each other. If these chemicals are out of balance or are not working properly, messages may not make it through the brain correctly, leading to symptoms of mental illness. In addition, defects in or injury to certain areas of the brain also have been linked to some mental conditions.: Some mental illnesses may be triggered by psychological trauma suffered as a child, such as severe emotional, physical, or sexual abuse; a significant early loss, such as the loss of a parent; and neglect.: Certain stressors -- such as a death or divorce, a dysfunctional family life, changing jobs or schools, and-- can trigger a disorder in a person who may be at risk for developing a mental illness." ,

"MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)" : "MERS-CoV is a new novel coronavirus that caused severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012. The infection appears to be the result of spread of the virus from camels to humans, resulting in limited person-to-person spread but not sustained transmission in humans.The largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. It was linked to a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula.MERS-CoV is a type of coronavirus, similar to the one that caused() and the. MERS-CoV has not been previously identified in humans. Like the SARS virus, MERS-CoV is most similar to coronaviruses found in bats. It has been detected in camels, and several cases of MERS-CoV in those who handle camels have been reported. Other livestock do not seem to be affected.The infection can be spread from person to person through respiratory secretions. It may be transmitted from camels to humans. Those who handle camels are at higher risk of MERS-CoV infection than people who do not have regular close contacts with camels.Infected people have symptoms of a-like illness followed byGastrointestinal symptoms may also occur.Severely affected people experience respiratory failure and may need mechanical ventilation. Older people and those with underlying illnesses are at higher risk for severe disease.In 2014, MERS-CoV was diagnosed in the U.S. in two individuals who were not linked to each other. Both were travelers who lived and worked in Saudi Arabia, and both were health-care workers. Other countries, outside of the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding countries, have detected MERS-CoV only in travelers from these areas.MERS-CoV infection should be suspected in travelers from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries with symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV occurring within 10 days of traveling.If there are grounds for suspicion, public-health authorities need to be alerted.Similar to SARS, there is no medication that is known to treat MERS-CoV. Treatment is supportive.During the 2003 SARS outbreak, approximately 25% of people had severe respiratory failure and 10% died. In contrast, mortality in MERS is higher at about 50%." ,

Unfortunately, a 2015-2016 outbreak ofin Brazil has been associated with a large number of infants born with microcephaly. Epidemiological and some viral isolations suggest that pregnant women who get Zika virus have a high chance of fetal infection that may lead to microcephaly, although a definitive link between Zika virus infection and microcephaly is not yet proven.Signs and symptoms of microcephaly may include a smaller than normal head circumference that usually remains smaller than normal as the child grows,or, delayed motor and speech functions, mental retardation,, facial distortions, hyperactivity, balance and coordination problems, and other brain-related or neurological problems; although some with the disorder may develop normal intelligence.There is no treatment to change the head size; programs are available to help these individuals reach their maximum potential andmay help explain the risk for microcephaly in future pregnancies. Women who are interested in becoming pregnant are being advised by the CDC and other agencies to avoid traveling to areas where Zika virus is found to reduce the chance of becoming infected while pregnant.Research on microcephaly is ongoing; for example, researchers found that amino acid therapy may reduceactivity in some patients.

"Ricin" : "Ricin is a toxic protein found naturally in castor beans from the castor bean plant (Ricinus communis). It can be deadly, but it depends on the dose and route of exposure. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed ricin can be released, however, simply chewing the beans wont necessarily kill a person.Castor beans are processed to make castor oil, and ricin is part of the waste produced in this process.If ingested, ricin gets inside the bodys cells and prevents them from making proteins they need, killing those cells.It was discovered in 1888 by Peter Hermann Stillmark, a German scientist, working in Russia, who extracted the substance from castor beans.Protein toxins such as ricin have been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.Early symptoms ingestion usually occur in less than 10 hours. Early symptoms poisoning by inhalation may appear within 4 to 24 hours.It only takes a small amount to kill an adult.This type of poisoning is highly unlikely. It usually needs to be ingested or injected, and large amounts need to be inhaled to be toxic.There is no antidote for ricin poisoning, thus there is no cure for it. Avoiding exposure is the best preventative.If exposure cannot be avoided, the first step in treatment is to get it off or out of the body as quickly as possible.Treatment for poisoning involves supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poison.Castor beans are processed throughout the world to make castor oil. Ricin is part of the waste mash produced when castor oil is made.Ricin is a poison protein found naturally in castor beans from the castor bean plant (). If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury.It can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid.It is a stable substance under normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 degrees centigrade (176 degrees Fahrenheit).The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases.Initial symptoms of poisoning bymay occur as early as 4- 8 hours and as late as 24 hours after exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 10 hours.Within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing),,,, and tightness in the chest. Heavymay follow as well as fluid building up in the(). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excesswould be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally,and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to it, people having respiratory symptoms should seek medical care.If someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would likely developandthat may become bloody. Severemay be the result, followed by. Other signs or symptoms may include, and. Within several days, the person's, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die.It is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes. However, if you touch ricin that is on your skin and then eat food with your hands or put your hands in your mouth, you may ingest some.Ricin poisoning could kill a person within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received.Effects of this type of poisoning depend on whether it was inhaled, ingested, or injected.It is difficult to say exactly how much ricin could kill a person as it depends on the castor beans: their size, weight, moisture content, time of harvest, and other factors. The minimum number of castor beans associated with death was 2, but it symptoms of castor bean poisoning have been documented with as few as one half a bean, to up to 30 beans.It would take a deliberate act to make ricin and use it to poison people. Unintentional exposure to ricin is highly unlikely, except through the ingestion of castor beans.If made into a partially purified material or refined into a terrorist or warfare agent, ricin could be used to expose people through the air, food, or water.In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin.In the 1940s the U.S. military experimented with using ricin as a possible warfare agent. In some reports ricin has possibly been used as a warfare agent in the 1980s in Iraq and more recently by terrorist organizations.Ricin poisoning is not. Ricin-associated illness cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. However, if you come into contact with someone who has ricin on their body or clothes, you could become exposed to it.In the 1940s the U.S. military experimented with using it as a possible warfare agent. In some reports it has possibly been used as a warfare agent in the 1980s in Iraq and more recently by terrorist organizations.In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella.

"Wound Closures (Stitches)" : "Wounds or lacerations must be explored and thoroughly cleaned prior to closure.Suture materials vary in their composition and thickness, and the choice of the appropriate material depends upon the nature and location of the.Staples, Steri-Strips, Band-Aids, and skin glue can be alternatives to suture material for skin closure.Dissolvable suture material may be used for the repair of deep tissues.Most sutures are left in place for seven to 10 days.Exploration: Most wounds need to be examined and explored to their full depth, looking for dirt and debris that may have entered and making certain that the anatomic structures beneath the damaged skin are intact and not injured. For example, in a hand or finger laceration, the care provider will want to make certain that the blood vessels, nerves, and tendons beneath the skin have not been cut. This is done both by physical examination of the hand and finger, evaluating their power and motion, blood supply and nerve sensation, and also by looking inside the wound, identifying the tendon and perhaps the artery and nerve bundles to make certain that they are intact.Cleaning: When the skin is broken, the outside world invades the body and may cause infection. Before the skin is closed, the wound must be washed out or irrigated thoroughly to prevent the occurrence of an infection. Sometimes, a small amount of dirty tissue needs to be cut out, and this is called debridement." ,

After about four to seven days, lesions (pustules,) develop on the face and trunk that ulcerate, crust over, and begin to clear up after about 14-21 days, andenlarge. There may be some scarring.The diagnosis of monkeypox is often made presumptively in Africa by the patient's history and the exam that shows the pox lesions, however, a definitive diagnosis is made by, ELISA, or Western blotting tests that are usually done by the CDC or some state labs. Definitive diagnosis is important to rule out other possible infectious agents like smallpox.Treatment may consist of immediate vaccination withbecause monkeypox is so closely related to smallpox. Treatment with an antiviral drug or human immune globulin has been done.In general, the prognosis for monkeypox is good to excellent as most patients recover. The prognosis may decrease in immunocompromised patients, and patients with other problems such as malnutrition or lung disease may have a poorer prognosis.Monkeypox is preventable as long as people avoid direct contact with infected animals and people. Vaccination against smallpox seems to afford about an 85% chance of avoiding the infection. There is no commercially available vaccine specifically for monkeypox.Research is ongoing to study antivirals, genetics, and rapid tests for monkeypox." ,

"Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy" : "by proxy (MSBP) is now classified as a somatic symptom and related disorder. It is referred to as factitious disorder that is imposed by one individual on another or factitious disorder by proxy.MSBP is characterized by feigning or intentionally producing physical or emotional symptoms in another person in order to place that person in the sick role.This disorder is named after Baron Karl Friedrich von Munchausen, who was known to invent fantastic stories of his adventures, including his riding cannonballs and traveling to the moon.MSBP specifically involves a caretaker describing nonexistent symptoms or inducing symptoms in a third person, usually a child they care for.How often MSBP occurs is likely very much underestimated, as evidenced by it often taking years to be discovered, even being completely missed in siblings of the victim that is eventually identified.Males are victims of MSBP as often as females. Women are perpetrators of this disorder the vast majority of the time, theoretically because women remain the primary caretakers of children.Perpetrators of MSBP are vulnerable to also suffering from,, and some personality disorders.While there is no specific cause for MSBP, perpetrators tend to have trouble forming a healthy attachment to their children, difficulty managing their anger and frustration, as well as having an ability to overcome the more natural tendency for caretakers to protect the children they care for.Perpetrators are also more likely to have a history of either losing a parent or being abused or neglected as a child.While the symptoms the victim of MSBP presents with are highly variable, they may consist of symptoms that are more easily faked or induced, like suffocation,, bleeding or,, orthat can be the result of poisoning.Theories about what perpetrators gain from assuming the sick role through their child include seeking help, inducing symptoms, and being addicted to interactions with medical professionals.MSBP is usually diagnosed through intensive communication between medical, mental-health, and child-protection professionals, as well as review of all available medical records and interviewing family members, school personnel, and other pertinent community members.Sometimes, covertly videotaping the suspected abuser when with the child can be a useful additional diagnostic tool.The treatment of MSBP involves close collaboration with professionals, family, and community members, intensivefor the victim and the perpetrator, as well as protecting the child by either intensive supervision of the perpetrator, temporary or permanent removal of the child from the care of the abuser, and sometimes includes prosecution and incarceration of the perpetrator.If left untreated, MSBP can result in the child's death or growing up emotionally and/or medically disabled." ,

Such drugs (for example, prednisone) have since benefited many, but are not without potential side effects.The two major problems related to continuous steroid treatment areThe production of corticosteroids is controlled by a feedback mechanism, involving the adrenal glands, the, and brain, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA).Using large doses for a few days, or smaller doses for more than two weeks, leads to a prolonged decrease in HPAA function.Steroid use cannot be stopped abruptly; tapering the drug gives the adrenal glands time to return to their normal patterns of secretion.Withdrawal symptoms and signs (weakness,, decreased appetite,,,,,) can mimic many other medical problems. Some may be life-threatening.Tapering may not completely prevent withdrawal symptoms. Steroid withdrawal may involve many factors, including a true physiological dependence on corticosteroids.Patients should carry a list of all their medications in their wallet to alert medical personnel in case of emergency.Supplementation with corticosteroid medication may be needed during periods of(such as surgery), even up to a year after stopping corticosteroid therapy.Diagnosis of steroid withdrawal can be difficult. Diagnosis is easier if the patient indicates they have recently stopped or decreased a steroid medication, such as prednisone or prednisolone.Treatment of steroid withdrawal is tailored to the individual. Treatment usually involves steroid administration that is decreased gradually over weeks to months.Physicians who treat steroid withdrawal include primary-care physicians, endocrinologists, internal-medicine specialists, and others.The prognosis of steroid withdrawal, if diagnosed early and treated appropriately, is usually good.It is possible to prevent steroid withdrawal by using steroids over short lengths of time. Patients who use steroids for lengthy periods of time may prevent steroid withdrawal by slowly tapering or weaning the dose of the steroid under the direction of a physician." ,

However, as the disease progresses from moderate to severe, the prognosis decreases from good to poor; early effective treatment may improve the prognosis.Prevention of GAS infections is possible by attention to good hygiene such as hand washing and avoiding eating or drinking from the same containers used by other people and avoiding direct and indirect (for example, droplet or particle contamination of clothing) contact with a infected individual; early treatment of GAS infections can reduce or prevent the progression to more severe disease.Although research is ongoing, there is no commercially available vaccine to prevent GAS infections." ,

If they communicate a plan to anyone, it is more likely to be a friend or family member.The assessment of suicide risk often involves an evaluation of the presence, severity, and duration of suicidal thoughts as part of a mental-health evaluation.Treatment of suicidal thinking or a suicide attempt involves adapting immediate treatment to the sufferer's individual needs. Those with a strong social support system, who have a history of being hopeful, and have a desire to resolve conflicts may need only a brief crisis-oriented intervention. Those with more severe symptoms or less social support may need hospitalization and long-term outpatient mental-health services.Treatment of any underlying emotional problem using a combination of, safety planning, medication, lifestyle improvement, and increasing social support remains the mainstay of suicide prevention.People who are contemplating suicide are encouraged to talk to a doctor or other health professional, spiritual advisor, or immediately go to the closest emergency room or mental-health crisis center for help. Those who have experienced suicidal thinking (ideation) are commonly directed to keep a list of people to call in the event that those thoughts return. In addition to mental-health treatment, other strategies include having someone else hold all medications to prevent overdose, removing any weapons from the home, scheduling frequent-relieving activities, getting together with others, writing down feelings, and avoiding the use of alcohol or other drugs.Techniques for coping with the suicide of a loved one include nutritious eating, getting extra rest, writing about their emotions, talking to others about the experience, thinking of ways to handle painful memories, understanding their state of mind will vary, resisting pressure to grieve by anyone else's time table, and survivors doing what is right for them.To help children and adolescents cope with the suicide of a loved one, it is important to ensure they receive consistent caretaking, frequent interaction with supportive peers and adults, and an understanding of their feelings as they relate to their age." ,

Individuals with sensitive teeth and gums, receding gums and/or defective restorations should consult with their dentist prior to using a tooth whitening system. Anyoneto peroxide (the whitening agent) should not use a bleaching product.Gum disease, worn enamel,, and exposed roots. Individuals with gum disease or teeth with worn enamel are generally discouraged from undergoing a tooth whitening procedure. Cavities need to be treated before undergoing any whitening procedure. This is because the whitening solutions penetrate into any existing decay and the inner areas of the tooth, which can cause sensitivity. Also, whitening procedures will not work on exposed tooth roots because roots do not have an enamel layer.Fillings, crowns and other restorations. Tooth-colored fillings and resin composite materials used in dental restorations (crowns, veneers, bonding,) do not whiten. Therefore, using a whitening agent on teeth that do and do not contain restorations will results in uneven whitening-in this case, making the teeth without restorations appear lighter than those with restorations. Any whitening procedure should be done prior to the placement of, bonding, veneers, crowns,, or porcelain restorations in order to best match the degree of whitening to your new tooth color. A minimum of 2 weeks following a whitening procedure should be allowed before crowns, bondings, or veneers are completed. This will allow enough time for the enamel to remineralize and optimize the bonding strength. Tooth-colored fillings will need to be replaced after the bleaching process is complete. Individuals with numerous restorations that would result in uneven whitening may be better off considering bonding, veneers or crowns rather than a tooth whitening system. Ask your dentist what strategy may be best for you.Unrealistic expectations. Individuals who expect their teeth to be a new blinding white may be disappointed with their results. Smokers need to be aware that their results will be limited unless they refrain from continued, particularly during the bleaching process. A healthy guide as to a reasonable degree of whiteness to achieve with a whitening process that would give a natural appearance to a person's teeth is a slightly whiter color than the whites of your eyes.Darkly stained teeth. Yellow-ish teeth respond well to bleaching, brownish-colored teeth respond less well, and grayish-hue or purple-stained teeth may not respond well to bleaching at all.
