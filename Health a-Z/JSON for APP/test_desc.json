{"Abdominoplasty (Tummy Tuck ( Abdominoplasty))" : "Are sit-ups just not giving you the taut tummy you desire? If you've got a little too much flab or excess skin in your abdomen that won't diminish withor, you may want to consider an abdominoplasty, popularly referred to as a tummy tuck.This procedure flattens your abdomen by removing extra fat and skin, and tightening muscles in your abdominal wall.However, this is a major surgery. So if you're considering it, take the time to educate yourself, thoroughly analyze your own situation and do not rush to make the final decision.A tummy tuck should be the last resort for people who have exhausted all other measures, and the procedure should not be used as an alternative to.A tummy tuck is suitable for both men and women who are in good overall general health.It should not be confused with a(theused to remove fat deposits), although your surgeon may elect to perform liposuction as part of a tummy tuck.Women who have muscles and skin stretched by multiple pregnancies may find the procedure useful to tighten those muscles and reduce that skin. A tummy tuck is also an alternative for men or women who wereat one point in their lives and still have excessive fat deposits or loose skin in the abdominal area.If you're a woman who is still planning to have children, then you may want to postpone a tummy tuck until you're through bearing children. Here's why: During surgery, your vertical muscles are tightened. Future pregnancies can separate these muscles.Are you still planning to lose a lot of weight? If so, you do not want to consider a tummy tuck.It's important to note that a tummy tuck can cause prominent, permanent scarring. If this is something you don't want, you may want to reconsider. Your doctor will discuss all these options with you when you go for the consultation. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",

"Absorbent Products Incontinence (Urinary Incontinence Products for Men)" : "Lots of men hate the idea of usingproductsthe so-called adult diapers, urine collection bags, and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male incontinence, these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options.While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, aan absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases,nserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a largeror pair of absorbentmay be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you.Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like. The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",
"Abstinence Method of Birth Control (Natural Methods of Birth Control)" : "Natural methods ofare considered natural because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these natural methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.(FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicatehas occurred or is about to occur.On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days inmucos), the actual time during which a woman may becomeis measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control.

"Acupuncture" : "Acupuncture is a component of the health care system of China that can be traced back at least 2,500 years. The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that there are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease. Acupuncture may, it has been theorized, correct imbalances of flow at identifiable points close to the skin.The practice of acupuncture to treat identifiable pathophysiological (disease) conditions in American medicine was rare until the visit of President Richard M. Nixon to China in 1972. Since that time, there has been an explosion of interest in the United States and Europe in the application of the technique of acupuncture to Western medicine.Acupuncture is a family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomical locations on or in the skin by a variety of techniques. There are a variety of approaches to diagnosis and treatment in American acupuncture that incorporate medical traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries. The most thoroughly studied mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin, solid, metallic needles, which are manipulated manually or by electrical stimulation.After reviewing the existing body of knowledge, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed acupuncture needles from the category of experimental medical devices. The FDA now regulates acupuncture needles, just as it does other devices such as surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes, under good manufacturing practices and single-use standards of sterility.",

"Allergy, Skin Test (Skin Test For Allergy)" : "A skin test is a test done on the skin to identify if a substance (an) is potentially triggering an. Environmental allergens (aeroallergens), including furry animals, dust mites, tree, grass pollen, weed pollen, and molds can causeeye symptoms, nasal symptoms, and asthma symptoms. Allergens that can trigger allergic reactions involving the skin, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, andinclude foods, medications, latex, and insect venoms.skin testing is noninvasive and generally very well tolerated, even by small children. A small amount of the suspected-provoking substance (the allergen) is placed on the skin. The skin is then gently punctured through the small drop with a special sterile puncture device. Anskin test is also called a prick/puncture test. The older terminology was scratch test. With venoms, certain medications, such as penicillin, and in certain cases with aeroallergens, a second step of testing involves injecting a small amount of the allergen into the skin with a small needle. This is called an intradermal or an intracutaneous test. This type of testing should never be performed for foods.A positive skin test involves the formation of a bump (wheal) and redness (flare). In addition to the allergens in question, skin testing is also performed with a positive control (histamine) that should always cause a skin reaction, and a negative control, (saline), that should not cause a reaction. A test is positive if the allergen causes a wheal 3 mm greater than the negative control, and if the skin has a response to the histamine, as well. It is important to know that individuals cannot undergo skin testing if they are using antihistamines, since this blocks the histamine-mediated reaction.For example, if a specificis suspected, a skin test uses a dilute extract of the suspected food. A small drop of this particular liquid extract is placed on the skin of the forearm or back. This underlying skin is gently punctured through the small drop with a special puncture device. The test is positive if there is a wheal and flare response described above. A positive test raises the possibility of a true allergy but is not diagnostic or confirmatory for having a true allergy. If there is no reaction with a wheal and flare, the test is read as negative and being allergic is very unlikely. If the skin test is positive, it implies that the patient has a type of antibody (IgE) on specialized cells in the skin that release histamine to cause symptoms of an allergic reaction. These cells are called mast cells and the IgE antibody bound to them is specific to the food being tested, like a puzzle piece. It is important to note that a positive skin test does not automatically mean a person is allergic to a food, medication, or aeroallergen. The skin test is one component of the information an allergist uses to make an accurate diagnosis, but the most important information comes from the patient's reported symptoms.",
"AMA (Antimitochondrial Antibodies)" : "Between 95 and 98% of patients with() have autoantibodies (antibodies to self) in their blood that react with the inner lining of mitochondria. These autoantibodies are called antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Mitochondria are the energy factories present inside all of our cells, not just the cells of theor bile ducts. (The mitochondria use the oxygen carried in the blood from theas a fuel to generate energy.) AMA actually bind to protein antigens that are contained in multienzyme complexes (packages of enzymes) within the inner lining of the mitochondria. These multienzyme complexes produce key chemical reactions necessary for life. The complexes are referred to as multienzyme because they are made up of multiple enzyme units.AMA specifically react against a component of this multienzyme complex called E2. In PBC, AMA preferentially react with the E2 component of one of the multienzymes that is called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Accordingly, the antigen is designated as PDC-E2. The practical importance of all of this is that the PDC-E2 antigen is now used, as discussed below, in a diagnostic test for PBC. The PDC-E2 antigen is also referred to as M2, a term introduced to designate it as the second mitochondrial antigen discovered by researchers interested in PBC.In as much as the bile ducts are the main targets of destruction in PBC, the question was asked whether the AMA reacts with the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts. So, investigators prepared antibodies to PDC-E2. As expected, they found that these antibodies bound to the mitochondria within the cells. But, sure enough, recent information suggests that these AMA autoantibodies also bind to PDC-E2 that lies outside the mitochondria, yet within the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts.This accumulation of PDC-E2 within the biliary epithelial cells is observed exclusively in the livers of patients with PBC, and not in normal livers or in livers from patients with any other types of. Interestingly, it was also observed in the livers of those two to five percent of PBC patients who do not have AMA in their blood (AMA-negative PBC). Furthermore, intense binding of these antibodies to biliary epithelial cells was also found to be the earliest indication of recurrence of PBC in a transplanted liver. (PBC is sometimes treated by liver transplantation.)Nevertheless, no evidence exists that the AMA itself causes the destruction of the biliary epithelial cells lining the small bile ducts. Neither the presence nor the amount (titer) of AMA in the blood appears to be related to the inflammatory destruction of the bile ducts. Indeed, immunization of animals with PDC-E2 antigen results in production of AMA without any liver or bile duct damage (pathology).",
"Amniocentesis" : "Amniocentesis is a procedure wherein a sample of fluid is removed from the amniotic sac for analysis. The amniotic sac is found within the uterine cavity. The amniotic sac is the fluid-filled structure inside a pregnant woman's uterus within which the baby lives. Fetal cells, proteins, and fetal urine freely move within this sac.During amniocentesis, fluid is removed by placing a long needle through the abdominal wall into amniotic sac. Sometimes, the woman's skin is injected first with a local anesthetic, but this is not usually necessary. The amniocentesis needle is typically guided into the sac with the help ofimaging performed either prior to or during the procedure. Once the needle is in the sac, a syringe is used to withdraw the clear amber-colored amniotic fluid, that resembles urine. The volume of fluid withdrawn depends upon the age of the fetus and the reason for the procedure.The fluid can then be sent for evaluation of fetal lung maturity, genetic evaluation, evidence of(a birth defect in spinal cord development) or other neural-tube defects, the presence of infection, or fetal chromosomal analysis. Chromosomes are structures which contain all of the genetic information within our cells. Amniotic fluid contains numerous free-floating fetal cells that can be grown in the laboratory. When these cells multiply and reach a certain number, their chromosomes are extracted and analyzed. It takes approximately two weeks to perform chromosomal analysis. The fluid also contains proteins,and other compounds that can be tested. These additional studies may require 1 to 7 days to perform. Data obtained from amniotic fluid can help women make informed decisions regarding their pregnancies.For most patients, amniocentesis is a fairly rapid and comfortable procedure. Some women experience uterine cramping after the procedure. They may also feel faint during or following the test.",
"ANA (Antinuclear Antibody)" : "We normally have antibodies in our blood that repel invaders in our bodies, such as virus and bacteria microbes. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are unusual antibodies, detectable in the blood, that have the capability of binding to certain structures within the nucleus of the cells. The nucleus is the innermost core within the body's cells and contains the DNA, the primary genetic material. ANAs are found in patients whose immune system may be predisposed to cause inflammation against their own body tissues. Antibodies that are directed against one's own tissues are referred to as autoantibodies. The propensity for the immune system to work against its own body is referred to as autoimmunity. ANAs suggest the possible presence of autoimmunity. Therefore, when they are detected in a patient's blood (referred to as a positive result), doctors will consider the possibility that an autoimmune illness exists in that patient.The ANA test was designed by Dr. George Friou in 1957. The ANA test is performed using a blood sample. An ANA test is performed by testing the blood in the laboratory. The antibodies in the serum of the blood are exposed in the laboratory to cells. It is then determined whether or not antibodies are present that react to various parts of the nucleus of cells. Thus, the term anti-nuclear antibody. Fluorescence techniques are frequently used to actually detect the antibodies in the cells, thus ANA testing is sometimes referred to as fluorescent antinuclear antibody test (FANA).The ANA test is a sensitive screening test used to detect autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases feature a misdirected immune system, and each of them has characteristic clinical manifestations that are used to make the precise diagnosis. The interpretation or identification of a positive ANA test does not make a diagnosis. It simply suggests to the doctor to consider the possibility that an autoimmune disease is present.Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which there is a disorder of the immune system characterized by the abnormal production of antibodies (autoantibodies) directed against the tissues of the body. Autoimmune diseases typically feature inflammation of various tissues of the body. Frequently, ANAs are found in patients with a number of different autoimmune diseases, such as,,,,,, juvenile,,,, glomerulonephritis, and. ANAs can also be found in patients with conditions that are not considered classic autoimmune diseases, such as chronic infections and.",
"Amino Acid, Homocysteine (Homocysteine)" : "Homocysteine is an amino acid that is produced by the body by chemically altering adenosine. Amino acids are naturally made products, which are the building blocks of all the proteins in the body.In 1969, Dr. Kilmer S. McCully reported that children born with acalled homocystinuria, which causes the homocysteine levels to be very high, sometimes died at a very young age with advanced atherosclerosis in their arteries. Homocysteine levels in the blood may be elevated for many reasons. More specifically, these reasons can be divided into severe genetic causes and other milder causes.In the genetic condition called homocystinuria, there is a deficiency or lack of an important mediator molecule (enzymes) in the complicated homocysteine breakdown pathway. This leads to severely elevated levels of homocysteine. In this rare and serious condition, there is a constellation of symptoms that include developmental delay,(thin bones), visual abnormalities, formation of, and advanced atherosclerosis (narrowing and hardening of blood vessels). This condition is mainly recognized in childhood.Milder genetic variations are more common causes of elevated homocysteine levels (hyperhomocysteinemia). In these conditions, the mediator molecules malfunction and are less efficient because of minor abnormality in their structure. They also lead to elevation of homocysteine levels, although much milder than in homocystinuria, by slowing down the breakdown of homocysteine.Mild elevation in homocysteine levels (hyperhomocysteinemia) are common, and seen in about 5% to 12% of the general population. In specific populations such as, alcoholics (due to poor vitamin intake) or patients with chronic, this may be more common. The severe genetic form, homocystinuria, is rare (0.02%).Currently, there is no direct proof that taking folic acid and Bto lower homocysteine levels preventsand. However, in a large population study involving women, those who had the highest consumption of folic acid (usually in the form of multivitamins) had fewerthan those who consumed the least amount of folic acid. In this study, the association between dietary intake of folate and vitamin B6 and risk ofwas more noticeable than between dietary intake of vitamin B12 and, which was minimal.Many other observational studies have been performed to assess the effect of folate and the other Bon. Most of these studies have concluded that oral intake of folate has been associated to lower risk of heart disease, possibly because due to lowering of homocysteine levels. The relation between oral intake of vitamin B12 and B6 and heart disease was not as obvious in many of these studies. In one study, it was concluded that even in people with elevated homocysteine levels due to genetic reasons, oral intake of folate and possibly the other B vitamins was related to lower incidence of heart disease.Most of these data, however, are obtained from observational studies rather than purely controlled scientific data. Therefore, it is important to mention that despite these studies suggesting an association between the intake of these vitamins and the lower incidence of heart disease, in general, there is no compelling clinical evidence to treat hyperhomocysteinemia other than homocystinuria (the severe genetic form) in regards to heart disease,, or blood clots. As stated previously, homocysteine levels are not routinely measured in individuals with these problems.",
"Analysis of Urine (Urinalysis)" : "A urinalysis is simply an analysis of the urine. It is a very common test that can be performed in many health-care settings, including doctors' offices, urgent-care facilities, laboratories, and hospitals.A urinalysis test is performed by collecting a urine sample from the patient in a specimen cup. Usually only small amounts (30-60 mLs) may be required for urinalysis testing. The sample can be either analyzed in the medical clinic or sent to a laboratory to perform the tests. Urinalysis is abbreviated UA.UA is in general easily available and relatively inexpensive. It is also a simple test and can provide many useful information about various diseases and conditions. Some physicians refer to urinalysis as a poor man's kidney biopsy because of the plethora of information that can be obtained about the health of the kidney or other internal diseases by this simple test.Urine can be evaluated by its physical appearance (color, cloudiness, odor, clarity), or macroscopic analysis. It can be also analyzed based on its chemical and molecular properties or microscopic assessment.Urinalysis is ordered by doctors for a number of reasons, including the following:",
"Annulus Support (Heart Valve Disease Treatment)" : "Diseasedcan be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss,, and length of hospital stay.Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (antransducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.Theis the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques.

"Anti-CCP (Citrulline Antibody)" : "Citrulline antibody is an immune protein (antibody) that binds to a nonstandard amino acid (citrulline) that is formed by removing amino groups from the natural amino acid, arginine. A chemical process known as citrullination causes this change to occur. Citrulline antibodies are measured with a blood (serum) test that is analyzed in laboratories. The test is also known as anti-citrulline antibody, cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCPA), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and anti-CCP.Research suggests that in the joints of patients with, proteins may be changed to citrulline as part of the process that leads to inflammation of the rheumatoid joint.Citrulline antibody is present in the blood of most patients with. It is used in the diagnosis ofwhen evaluating patients with unexplained. A test for citrulline antibodies is most helpful in looking for the cause of previously undiagnosed inflammatorywhen the substance detected by the traditional blood test for rheumatoid arthritis,, is not present. Citrulline antibodies have been felt to represent the earlier stages of rheumatoid arthritis in this setting and may be positive when the rheumatoid factor (RF) test is negative.The citrulline antibody test then can be used by doctors to encourage them to proceed with the optimal treatments directed toward rheumatoid arthritis. Research has found that the presence of citrulline antibodies has also been associated with a greater tendency toward more destructive forms of rheumatoid arthritis.",
"Angioplasty (Coronary Angioplasty)" : "of the coronary artery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), was introduced in the late 1970's. PTCA is a non-surgical procedure that relieves narrowing and obstruction of the arteries to the muscle of the heart (coronary arteries). This allows more blood and oxygen to be delivered to the. PTCA is now referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, as this term includes the use of balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices. Percutaneous coronary intervention is accomplished with a small balloon catheter inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist, and advanced to the narrowing in the coronary artery. The balloon is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. When successful, percutaneous coronary intervention can relieveof, improve the prognosis of individuals with unstable angina, and minimize or stop awithout having the patient undergo open heart() surgery.In addition to the use of simple balloon angioplasty, the availability of stents, in a wire-mesh design, have expanded the spectrum of people suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention, as well as enhanced the safety and long-term results of the procedure. Since the early 1990's, more and more patients are treated with stents, which are delivered with a percutaneous coronary intervention balloon, but remain in the artery as a scaffold. This procedure has markedly reduced the numbers of patients needing emergency CABG to below 1%, and particularly with the use of the new medicated stents (stents coated with medications that help prevent recurrence due to), has reduced the rate of recurrence of the blockage in the coronary artery (restenosis) to well below 10%. At present, the only patients treated with just balloon angioplasty are those with vessels less than 2mm (the smallest diameter stent), certain types of lesions involving branches of coronary arteries, those with scar tissue in old stents, or those who cannot take the antiplatelet blood thinners after the procedure.Various atherectomy (plaque removal) devices were initially developed as adjuncts to percutaneous coronary intervention. These include the use of thefor photoablation of plaque,(use of a high-speed diamond-encrusted drill) for mechanical ablation of plaque, andfor cutting and removal of plaque. Such devices were initially thought to decrease the incidence of restenosis, but inwere shown to be of little additional benefit, and now are only used in selective cases as an adjunct to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (percutaneous artery intervention).",
"Apgar Score" : "Most term infants make a successful and uneventful transition from living within the womb to the outside world. Some will need some medical intervention, and very few will require extensive resuscitation. A reproducible and rapidly determined rating system is necessary for evaluation of the condition of theinfant. The Apgar score is a practical method for assessing a neonate.The Apgar score is a number calculated by scoring the heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, skin color, and reflex irritability (response to a catheter in the nostril). Each of these objective signs can receive 0, 1, or 2 points.A perfect Apgar score of 10 means an infant is in the best possible condition. An infant with an Apgar score of 0-3 needs immediate resuscitation. It is important to note that diligent care of the newborn is an immediate response to the current status of the infant. It is inappropriate to wait until Apgar scores are obtained to begin or continue to address the needs of the neonate.The Apgar score is done routinely 60 seconds after the birth of the infant and then is repeated five minutes after birth.In the event of a difficult resuscitation, the Apgar score may be done again at 10, 15, and 20 minutes.The persistence of low (0-3) Apgar scores at 20 minutes of age is predictive of high rates of morbidity (disease) and mortality (death). In term infants, the five-minute Apgar score is predictive of mortality but is not as precise a predictor for neurologic and developmental disabilities. In high-risk (prematurity, low birth weight, etc.) infants, Apgar scores are less sensitive regarding long- term predictions of mental and neurological health.",

"Arthritis Physical and Occupational Therapy" : "treatment may include physical therapy and/or occupational therapy.People with arthritis often have stiff joints -- largely because they avoid movements that can increase. By not moving arthritic joints, however, the stiffness andonly get worse. Therefore, people with arthritis often benefit from physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you how to work out stiffness without further damaging your joint. Physical therapy also is useful after an injury, such as from a fall, and after joint surgery, especially for artificial joint replacement.Occupational therapy can teach you how to reduce strain on your joints during daily activities. Occupational therapists can show you how to modify your home and workplace environments to reduce motions that may aggravate arthritis. They also may provide splints for your hands or wrists, and recommend assistive devices to aid in tasks such as driving, bathing, dressing, housekeeping, and certain work activities.The goal of physical therapy is to get a person back to the point where he or she can perform normal, everyday activities without difficulty.Preserving good range of motion is key to maintain the ability to perform daily activities. Therefore, increasing the range of motion of a joint is the primary focus of physical therapy. Building strength in the involved muscles surrounding the joint also is extremely important, since stronger muscles can better stabilize a weakened joint.Physical therapists provide exercises designed to preserve the strength and use of your joints. They can show you the best way to move from one position to another and can also teach you how to useaids such as crutches, a walker or a cane, if necessary.If you have arthritis, there are many benefits to participating in a physical and occupational therapy program, including: 2005-2017.

In knee orsurgery, the artificial joint is made out of metal and.  In the case of joint replacement in the hand, the new joint is most commonly composed of silicone rubber or the patient's own tissues such as a portion oftendon.Joint replacement surgery, also known as arthroplasty, is very common. Each year, orthopedic surgeons perform thousands of joint replacement surgeries in the U.S.  (Most of these procedures are performed on the large weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees.) Joint replacement surgery in the hand is typically used in treating severethat involves the small joints of the hand.The hips and knees receive continuousfrom,, sporting activity, or injury and are more commonly affected by the wearing of cartilage () than the  hand joints.  However, the joints of the hand do experiencein everyday use, and because the hand joints are smaller, these stresses are concentrated over a smaller surface area. The high ratio of stress to surface area can cause the smooth joint cartilage to wear over the years.  As the cartilage degenerates, the underlying bone becomes exposed.  When the deteriorated joint moves, bone rubs upon bone causing, swelling, limiting motion, and frequently causing a grinding or popping sensation.  Furthermore, forms of arthritis that are caused by inflammation of the tissues lining the joint frequently affect the small joints of the hands and wrists to cause joint destruction.

"Arthrocentesis (Joint Aspiration)" : "A joint aspiration is a procedure whereby a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain synovial fluid from a patient's joint. Joint aspiration is typically performed by a doctor or ancillary health care provider as an office procedure or at the bedside of hospitalized patients. Joint aspiration is sometimes called joint drainage and is medically referred to as arthrocentesis.Patients do not need any special preparation before a joint aspiration. The aspiration is easily performed in a doctor's office as an outpatient procedure.is minimized by topical or local anesthetics applied onto the patient's skin or just beneath the skin. Usually, there is a momentary, slight amount ofas the needle is inserted into the patient's joint space. Withdrawal of the fluid into the syringe does not typically cause pain. Injection of medication into the joint does not typically cause pain. There is very slight pain sometimes as the needle is withdrawn from the joint. Any pain is reduced by topical or local anesthetics that block pain sensation.Joint aspiration can be both used for diagnosis and medical treatment ofof a joint. Joint aspiration is used to obtain fluid from the patient's joint for examination in the laboratory. Analysis of joint fluid can help the physician to define causes of joint swelling (joint effusion) or arthritis, such as infection,arthritis, and. Fluid from the joint can be tested for white cell count, crystals, protein, glucose, as well as cultured to detect infection. Each of these laboratory parameters can be helpful in defining the cause of a particular form of arthritis, particularly in distinguishing inflammatory from non-inflammatory forms of arthritis. The result can be key to identifying various potentialdiseases and musculoskeletal conditions.Joint aspiration can also be a helpful treatment in relieving joint swelling and pain. Removal of synovial fluid from the joint that is inflamed can also remove the white blood cells within that are sources of enzymes that can be destructive to the joint. This treatment can more rapidly restore the health of the joint. Bursa aspiration procedure and indications forare analogous to joint aspiration for arthritis, except the bursa is the target instead of the joint (intra-articular). The result and analysis of the fluid (aspirate) is similarly evaluated for various diseases and conditions in the laboratory.",
"Anti-Reflux Surgery (Fundoplication)" : "During the fundoplication procedure, the part of the stomach that is closest to the entry of the esophagus (the fundus of the stomach) is gathered, wrapped, and sutured (sewn) around the lower end of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter. (The gathering and suturing of one tissue to another is called plication.) This procedure increases the pressure at the lower end of the esophagus and thereby reduces acid reflux.Also, during fundoplication, other surgical steps frequently are taken that also may reduce acid reflux. For instance, if the patient has a(which occurs in 80% of patients with GERD), the contents of the hernia sac (the stomach) may be pulled down from the chest and the opening the diaphragm (the hiatus) through which the esophagus passes from the chest into the abdomen sutured so that stomach remains within the abdomen. Fundoplication may be done using a large incision (laparotomy in the abdomen or thoracotomy in the chest) or a laparoscope, which requires only several small punctures in the abdomen. The advantage of the laparoscopic method is a speedier recovery and less post-operative.Although fundoplication is the standard surgical method for treating GERD, endoscopic methods for treating GERD are being developed.utilizes endoscopes, which are long flexible tubes that are passed by the doctor through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach. The inside of the esophagus can be viewed through the endoscope and various instruments can be passed through channels in the endoscope.In one endoscopic method for treating GERD, an instrument is inserted that delivers an electrical current to the lower esophageal sphincter. This results in scarring which tightens the sphincter. In asecond method,are placed in the sphincter to tighten the sphincter.Other methods also have been employed experimentally. Endoscopic methods offer a simpler way of treating GERD than fundoplication.

"Arthroscopy" : "Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure by which the internal structure of a joint is examined for diagnosis and/or treatment using a tube-like viewing instrument called an arthroscope. Arthroscopy was popularized in the 1960s with the advent of fiberoptic technologies and is now commonplace throughout the world. Typically, it is performed by orthopedic surgeons in an outpatient setting. When performed in the outpatient setting, patients can usually return home on the same day the procedure is completed.The technique of arthroscopy involves inserting the arthroscope, a small tube that contains optical fibers and lenses, through tiny incisions in the skin into the joint to be examined. The arthroscope is connected to a video camera and the interior of the joint is seen on a television monitor. The size of the arthroscope varies with the size of the joint being examined. For example, the knee is examined with an arthroscope that is approximately 5 millimeters in diameter. There are arthroscopes as small as 0.5 millimeters in diameter to examine small joints such as the wrist.If procedures are performed in addition to examining the joint with the arthroscope, this is called arthroscopic surgery. There are a number of procedures that are done in this fashion. If a procedure can be done arthroscopically instead of by traditional surgical techniques, it usually causes less tissue, may result in less, and may promote a quicker recovery.",

"Autism Screening and Diagnosis" : "Diagnosingspectrum disorders (ASDs) can be difficult, since there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorders.

By age 2, a diagnosis by an experienced professional can be considered very reliable. However, many children do not receive a final diagnosis until much older.  This delay means that children with anmight not get the help they need.Diagnosing an ASD takes two steps:is a short test to tell if children are learning basic skills when they should, or if they might have delays.  During developmental screening the doctor might ask the parent some questions or talk and play with the child during an exam to see how she learns, speaks, behaves, and moves.  A delay in any of these areas could be a sign of a problem.All children should be screened for developmental delays and disabilities during regular well-child doctor visits at:In addition, all children should be screened specifically for ASDs during regular well-child doctor visits at:It is important for doctors to screen all children for developmental delays, but especially to monitor those who are at a higher risk for developmental problems due to preterm birth, low birth weight, or having a brother or sister with an ASD.If your child's doctor does not routinely check your child with this type of developmental screening test, ask that it be done.If the doctor sees any signs of a problem, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is needed.The second step of diagnosis is a comprehensive evaluation.

Therefore, any gallstones lodged in the ducts will go undetected on OCG.Failure to visualize the gallbladder on an OCG may occur for one of two reasons.  First, a gallstone may have obstructed the cystic duct and prevented the iodine-containing bile from entering the gallbladder. Second, inflammation of the gallbladder -- usually due to gallstones -- may have interfered with the gallbladder's ability to concentrate bile and iodine. Whichever the cause, failure to visualize the gallbladder on an OCG strongly suggests a diseased gallbladder.",
"Autopsy" : "An autopsy (also known as a post-mortem examination or necropsy) is the examination of the body of a dead person and is performed primarily to determine the cause of death, to identify or characterize the extent of disease states that the person may have had, or to determine whether a particular medical or surgical treatment has been effective. Autopsies are performed by pathologists, medical doctors who have received specialty training in the diagnosis of diseases by the examination of body fluids and tissues. In academic institutions, autopsies sometimes are also requested for teaching and research purposes. Forensic autopsies have legal implications and are performed to determine if death was an accident, homicide,, or a natural event. The word autopsy is derived from the Greek word autopsia: to see with one's own eyes.A medical examiner can order an autopsy without the consent of the next-of-kin. Deaths that are investigated by the medical examiner or coroner include all suspicious deaths, and, depending upon the jurisdiction, may include deaths of persons not being treated by a physician for a known medical condition, deaths of those who have been under medical care for less than 24 hours, or deaths that occurred during operations or other medical procedures.In all other cases, consent must be obtained from the next-of-kin before an autopsy is performed, even at academic institutions or hospitals.

"Gastric Banding Surgery (Lap Band Surgery (Gastric Banding))" : "is a growing concern. By medical standards, obesity is defined as having a() of over 30 kg/m2. While lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone for treatment, surgical options are becoming more popular. One of the surgical treatments for obesity is called gastric banding, commonly known as lap-band surgery. Some of the specifics of gastric banding will be addressed in this article.Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of an adjustable belt around the upper portion of the stomach using a laparascope. The band is made of silicone and can be tightened by adding saline to fill the band (like blowing air into a doughnut-shaped balloon). The band is connected to a port that is placed under the skin of the abdomen. This port is used to introduce or remove saline into the band.LAGB ultimately restricts the size of the stomach and the amount of food it can hold. It also slows the passage of food to the intestine. By doing so, signals to the brain from the gut allow for a sensation of fullness and satiety with the consumption of less food. This signal is sent from a small pouch created by the band in the upper stomach. When the pouch fills, the same signal is sent to the brain that occurred previously when the entire stomach filled.The LAP BAND is a specific device brand name and is made by Allergan Inc. The term is often used in the lay community interchangeable with gastric banding (similar to the way we interchange the brand name Kleenex for facial tissue). There are different sizes and models of the LAP BAND. There are also other companies that make gastric banding devices such as the REALIZE adjustable gastric band (by Ethicon), the MIDBAND, and the Heliogast gastric band (which are not available in the US).Generally, candidates for LAGB have a body mass index over 40 kg/m2, or are more than 45 kilograms over their ideal body weight. LAGB can be performed on a person with a BMI of 35-40 kg/m2 if there are problematic medical conditions that are weight-related, such as() or diabetes.Most surgeons and programs will want to note a history of failedin the past using more conventional approaches. The procedure is indicated for adults only, and is not to be performed on those less than 18 years old. All patients must demonstrate an understanding of the procedure, and be willing to adhere to the lifestyle changes that are needed to make this procedure successful. Most large centers have a psychological assessment to assure that this last criteria is met.LAGB is usually contraindicated if the potential patient has difficulty understanding the procedure, is emotionally unstable, or is dependent on drugs or alcohol. Those potential cases with a history of gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers need to be reviewed carefully. Similarly, those that have underlying medical conditions that make them high risk for surgery- such as heart or lung conditions- may be refused the procedure. Associated with these risks is a BMI of greater than 50kg/m2. In this group, there may be a request toprior to the procedure (although this seems paradoxical). Again, the risks of the procedure in this subgroup ofpatients may outweigh the benefits of surgery. By dropping the BMI under 50 kg.m2, outcomes may be better.While there is growing discussion about offering LAGB to those with a BMI of 30-35 who have, there are no current guidelines for this.",
"Gastric Bypass Surgery" : "Gastric bypass surgery combines the creation of a small stomach pouch to restrict food intake and construction of bypasses of the duodenum and other segments of the small intestine to cause malabsorption (decreased ability to absorb calories and nutrients from food).Gastric bypass surgery that causes malabsorption and restricts food intake produces morethan restriction operations like, which only decrease food intake.

"Gallbladder Scan (Cholescintigraphy)" : "Cholescintigraphy is a test done by nuclear medicine physicians to diagnose obstruction of the bile ducts (for example, by a gallstone or a), disease of the gallbladder, and bile leaks. It sometimes is referred to as a HIDA scan or a gallbladder scan.For cholescintigraphy, a radioactive chemical is injected intravenously into the patient. The test chemical is removed from the blood by theand secreted into the bile which is produced by the liver. The test chemical then disperses everywhere that the bile goes-into the bile ducts, the gallbladder, and the intestine. A camera that senses radioactivity (like a Geiger counter) is then placed over the patient's abdomen and a picture of the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder and surrounding areas is obtained which corresponds to where the radioactive chemical has traveled within the bile-filled liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder. Cholescintigraphy takes approximately two hours.There are various patterns of radioactivity that can be seen following the injection of the radioactive chemical, and each has a different meaning. If the test chemical is not detected in the liver, a diseased liver is probably indicated. If the chemical is absorbed by the liver but not secreted into the bile ducts, there probably is a complete obstruction of the bile ducts exiting the liver. When the test chemical fails to appear in the gallbladder, but is detected in the intestine, there probably is an obstruction of the cystic duct leading to and from the gallbladder. (Obstruction is most commonly caused byand, less commonly, by tumors. Parasites, andalso may obstruct infrequently.) Finally, if the chemical appears outside the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, or intestine, there probably is a bile leak from the bile ducts or gallbladder.Cholescintigraphy is most commonly used to diagnose problems with the gallbladder when other more commonly-performed tests, particularly, are normal or non-diagnostic. Cholescintigraphy can be modified with the addition of an intravenous injection of cholecystokinin, the hormone that is normally released by the body after a meal. This hormone causes the gallbladder to contract and squeeze out its bile into the intestine. Reduced contraction of the gallbladder following cholecystokinin (i.e., reduced emptying of the radioactivity from the gallbladder) may mean that there is disease of the gallbladder itself, particularly inflammation or scarring of the wall.",

Representative examples are:Unfortunately, no single characteristic element of either the patient's history or physical examination discriminates between strep thraot (GAS) and non-strep sore throat. As a result, it is imperative to have laboratory evaluation since strep throat should be treated with antibiotics, while relief of symptoms remains the mainstay of treatment for viral sore throats.",
"Gastric Emptying Study" : "The most common type of gastric emptying study is a procedure that is done by nuclear medicine physicians using radioactive chemicals that measures the speed with which food empties from the stomach and enters the small intestine. Gastric emptying studies are used for evaluating patients who are having symptoms that may be due to slow and, less commonly, rapid emptying of the stomach.  The symptoms of slow emptying are primarily,,, and abdominal fullness after eating.  The symptoms of rapid emptying are, weakness, or light-headedness after eating.For a gastric emptying study, a patient eats a meal in which the solid component of the meal (for example, scrambled eggs), the liquid component of the meal (for example, water), or both, are mixed with a small amount of radioactive material. A scanner (acting like a Geiger counter) is placed over the patient's stomach to monitor the amount of radioactivity in the stomach for several hours after the test meal is eaten. As the radioactively-labeled food empties from the stomach, the amount of radioactivity in the stomach decreases. The rate at which the radioactivity leaves the stomach reflects the rate at which food is emptying from the stomachSome medications such asrelievers and anticholinergic medications can cause a delay in emptying of the stomach, while other medications such as metoclopramide (Reglan) and erythromycin can cause rapid emptying of the stomach. Medications that slow emptying of the stomach can give a falsely abnormal test result, while medications that speed up emptying of the stomach can give a falsely normal result. Therefore, medications that affect  emptying of the stomach should be withheld for 48-72 hours before performing emptying studies.Abnormally high() levels also can slow emptying of the stomach. Therefore, it is important to control blood glucose levels to near normal levels before performing emptying studies in people withwho are prone to develop high blood glucose levels.",

The form is an agreement between you and your doctor, showing that you have discussed the test and how its results might affect your family.Here are some questions to consider when thinking about genetic testing:Most importantly, you'll need to obtain a family pedigree to determine if there is adevelopment pattern within your family. A family pedigree is a chart that shows the geneticof a person's ancestors, and is used to analyze inherited characteristics or diseases within a family.After outlining the family pedigree, a blood test can be given to determine if you have a. Keep in mind that the vast majority ofcases are not associated with agene. In addition, scientists do not know all of the genes that can cause breast, so doctors can only test you for the known genes.When someone with a cancer diagnosis and a family history of the disease has been tested and found to have an alteredorgene, the family is said to have a known mutation. If an association between the development of breast cancer and a breast cancer gene is made, then all family members willing to participate in genetic testing are asked to give a sample of blood. For many people, knowing their test results is important, because this information may help to guide future health care decisions for themselves and their families.A negative genetic test means that a breast cancer gene mutation was not identified. If genetic testing has previously identified a mutation in your family, then a negative test means you do not carry the specific mutation that was identified in your family. Therefore, you would have the same risk as the general population.

"Gastroscopy (Endoscopy)" : "Upper endoscopy is a procedure that enables the examiner (usually a gastroenterologist) to examine the(swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of small bowel) using a thin, flexible tube called the upper endoscope through which the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be viewed using a TV monitor.To accomplish a safe and complete examination, the stomach should be empty. The patient will most likely be asked to have nothing to eat or drink for six hours or more prior to the procedure.Prior to scheduling the procedure, the patient should inform his or her physician of any medications being taken, any, and all known health problems. This information will help the doctor determine whether the patient may need antibiotics prior to the procedure, and what potential medications should not be used during the exam because of the patient's. The information will provide the individual scheduling the procedure an opportunity to instruct the patient whether any of the medications should be held or adjusted prior to the endoscopy.Knowledge whether the patient has any major health problems, such as heart or lung diseases, will alert the doctor of possible need for special attention during the procedure.",

With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least 8 hours, but not more than 16 hours). The next morning, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives a dose of oral glucose (the dose depends upon the length of the test). There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person. Blood samples are taken up to four times at different time points after consumption of theto measure the.For the glucose tolerance test to give reliable results, the person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a). Also, the person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital) and should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose. In preparation for the oral glucose tolerance test, the person should eat and drink as they normally would. The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or consume.",
"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Test (Esophageal pH Monitoring)" : "Esophageal pH (pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution) monitoring is a procedure for measuring the reflux (regurgitation or backwash) of acid from the stomach into thethat occurs in().Esophageal pH monitoring is used to diagnose, to determine the effectiveness of medications that are given to prevent, and to determine if episodes of acidic reflux are causing episodes of. Monitoring esophageal pH also can be used to determine if acid is reaching the pharynx (lower throat) and is possibly responsible for such symptoms as,, and.Esophageal pH monitoring is performed by passing a thincatheter a sixteenth of an inch in diameter through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The sensor is positioned in the esophagus so that it is just above the lower esophageal sphincter, a specialized area of esophageal muscle that lies at the junction of the esophagus and stomach and prevents acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus. In this position the sensor records each reflux of acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid.The patient is sent home with the catheter and recorder in place and returns the next day to have them removed. During the 24 hours that the catheter is in place, the patient goes about his or her usual activities, for example, eating, sleeping, and working. Meals, periods of, and symptoms are recorded by the patient in a diary and/or by pushing buttons on the recorder.  After the catheter is removed, the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data it has gathered can be downloaded into the computer where it is analyzed and put into graphic form. The procedure can be modified by placing the sensor in the upper esophagus or pharynx to determine if refluxed acid is reaching the pharynx.The most recently-developed device for monitoring esophageal pH uses a capsule also known as the Bravo Capsule. The capsule contains an acid sensing probe, a battery, and a transmitter. The probe monitors the acid in the esophagus and transmits the information to a recorder that is worn by the patient on a belt. The capsule is introduced into the esophagus on a catheter through the nose or mouth and is attached to the lining of the esophagus with a clip. The catheter then is detached from the capsule and removed. Thus, there is no catheter protruding from the nose. The capsule transmits for two days or three days, and then the battery dies. Five to seven days later, the capsule falls off the esophageal lining and is passed in the stool as the capsule is not reusable.The advantages of the capsule device are related to the absence of a catheter connecting the probe to the recorder.  There is greater comfort without a catheter in the back of the throat, and patients are more likely to go to work and do more of their normal activities without feeling self-conscious about the appearance of the catheter to others. The disadvantages of the capsule are that it cannot be used in the pharynx (where it would be impossibly uncomfortable) and, so far, it has not been used in the stomach.",

"Deep Brain Stimulation" : "Deep brain stimulation (or DBS) is a way to inactivate parts of the brain that causeand its associated symptoms without purposefully destroying the brain. In deep brain stimulation, electrodes are placed in the thalamus (to treat essential tremor and) or in the globus pallidus (for).In deep brain stimulation electrodes are connected by wires to a type ofdevice (called an impulse generator, or IPG) implanted under the skin of the chest, below the collarbone. Once activated, the device sends continuous electrical pulses to the target areas in the brain, blocking the impulses that cause. This has the same effect as thalamotomy or pallidotomy surgeries without actually destroying parts of the brain.The IPG can easily be programmed using a computer that sends radio signals to the device. Patients are given special magnets or other devices so they can externally turn the IPG on or off.Depending on use, the stimulators may last three to five years. The IPG replacement procedure is relatively simple.Experts are unclear how deep brain stimulation works. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",
"D & C (Dilation and Curettage)" : "Dilation and curettage (D and C) is a procedure in which the cervix of the uterus is expanded (dilated) so that the uterine lining () can be removed with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curet or curette. The procedure is performed for a variety of reasons. Most commonly, this surgery is done in order to help determine the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. It can also be done to help determine the degree of abnormality of the endometrium incases or pre-cancerous cells that are detected by an in-office biopsy. D and C is also sometimes necessary to remove tissue after a.In general, a D and C is used to help determine the health of the uterine lining or to remove abnormal tissue. Occasionally, the procedure can correct some of the problems in the uterus such as polyps,, or tissue overgrowth.There are very few contraindications to D and C. Generally if a patient is too ill to undergo surgery, she should probably not have this procedure. Furthermore, if the patient is unable to move her legs apart, such as with severein the hips, the surgeon may not be able to perform the procedure since it requires enough movement of the legs to accommodate a speculum. If the patient isor thinks that she could be pregnant, she should not have the operation unless the D and C is for the purpose of an abortion or to treat a miscarriage.Before a D and C, the same general recommendations for other outpatient procedures apply. It is recommended that the patient take nothing by mouth (food, water, etc.) for at least 6 to 8 hours prior to the scheduled operation. Often, the doctor will see the patient the day before surgery to discuss the procedure and potential complications in greater detail.",
"Defibrillator (Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator)" : "An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a small electronic device installed inside the chest to prevent sudden death from cardiac arrest due to life threatening abnormally fast heart rhythms (tachycardias). The ICD is capable of monitoring the heart rhythm. When the heart is beating normally, the device remains inactive. If the heart develops a life-threatening tachycardia, the ICD can attempt pacing to bring the hear rhythm back to normal, or it can deliver an electrical shock(s) to the heart to terminate the abnormal rhythm and return the heart rhythm to normal.The heart is an organ consisting of four chambers that pump blood. The two upper chambers are called the right and left atria, and the two lower chambers called the right and left ventricles. Thereceives venous blood (oxygen-poor blood) from the body and pumps it into the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps the oxygen-poor blood to theto receive oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood from the lungs then travels to the left atrium and is pumped by the left atrium into the left ventricle. The left ventricle delivers the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. In addition to oxygen, the blood carries other nutrients (glucose,, etc.) to the organs.In order to keep a body healthy, the heart must deliver a sufficient amount of blood to the body. As a pump, the heart is most efficient in delivering blood when functioning within a certain heart rate range. Normally, the heart's natural pacemaker called the SA node (a special tissue located on the right atria wall), keeps the heartbeat (heart rate) in the normal range. Electrical signals generated by the SA node travel along special conduction tissues on the walls of the atria and the ventricles. These electrical signals cause the heart muscles to contract and pump blood in an orderly and efficient manner.",
"Delivery of a Baby (Labor and Delivery)" : "Every woman's experience is unique. Below are typical guidelines that will help you understand what to expect:Signs and symptoms of impending labor are not uniform among all women.Lightening is a term used to denote the descent of the fetal head into the pelvis as labor approaches. It can occur up to two weeks prior to the onset of labor, or it may not occur at all. At that time there may be increased pressure on the maternal bladder accompanied by the urge to urinate more frequently. Many women find it easier to breathe after lightening occurs because upward pressure on thediminishes.Release or passage of the  can be another sign that labor is near. Mucus produced by the cervical glands normally blocks the entrance to the cervix and helps prevent infection. When the fetal head impinges on the cervix, mucus from the cervical glands, along with a small amount of blood, is expelled. This results in a blood-tinged or brownish discharge being expelled from the vagina. Passage of the mucus plug may occur days before or after labor begins. It is also common after a vaginal examination.Spontaneous rupture of the fetal membranes is referred to as one's water breaking. This means that the membranes that surround the baby have ruptured, and clearis often expelled from the vagina at that time. Once this occurs, labor will generally ensue spontaneously. If it does not, induction of labor may be necessary to avoid infection ascending upward through the vagina into the uterus. Most commonly rupture of the membranes does not occur until labor has already begun.Finally, labor begins with the onset of contractions. At that point the cervix begins to thin out and dilate. When contractions begin to occur less than ten minutes apart, this frequently signals the onset of labor. Irregular contractions, known as Braxton-Hicks contractions or , occur toward the end ofduring the, and they do not necessarily signify that labor is imminent. Some women even experience these contractions during the. Braxton-Hicks contractions are usually milder than those of true labor, and they do not occur at regular intervals.",
"Dental (Fillings)" : "To treat a  cavity  your dentist will remove the decayed portion of the tooth and then fill the area on the tooth where the decayed material once lived.Fillings are also used to repair cracked or brokenand teeth that have been worn down from misuse (such as from nail-biting or  tooth grinding ).First, the dentist will numb the area around the tooth with a local anesthetic. Next, a drill,  airinstrument  or  laser  will be used to remove the decayed area. The choice of instrument depends on the individual dentist's comfort level, training, and investment in the particular piece of equipment as well as location and extent of the decay.Next, your dentist will probe or test the area during the decay removal process to determine if all the decay has been removed. Once the decay has been removed, your dentist will prepare the space for the filling by cleaning the cavity of bacteria and debris. If the decay is near the root, your dentist may first put in a liner made of glass ionomer, composite resin, or other material to protect the nerve. Generally, after the filling is in, your dentist will finish and polish it.Several additional steps are required for tooth-colored fillings and are as follows. After your dentist has removed the decay and cleaned the area, the tooth-colored material is applied in layers. Next, a special light that cures or hardens each layer is applied. When the multilayering process is completed, your dentist will shape the composite material to the desired result, trim off any excess material and polish the final restoration. 2005-2017.

Dental bridges are supported by either natural teeth or.Bridges:There are three main types of bridges:During the first visit, the abutment teeth are prepared for the crown. Preparation involves recontouring these teeth by removing a portion of enamel to allow room for a crown to be placed over them. Next, impressions of your teeth are made, which serve as a model from which the bridge, pontic, and crowns will be made by a dental laboratory. Your dentist will make a temporary bridge for you to wear to protect the exposed teeth and gums while your bridge is being made.During the second visit, your temporary bridge will be removed and the new permanent bridge will be checked and adjusted, as necessary, to achieve a proper fit. Multiple visits may be required to check the fit of the metal framework and bite. This is dependent on each individual's case. If the dental bridge is a fixed (permanent) bridge, your dentist may temporarily cement it in place for a couple of weeks to make sure it is fitting properly. After a couple weeks, the bridge is permanently cemented into place. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",

This needs to be smooth with no gaps or ledges.: These are the raised or pointy parts of a crown that are the primary tools for tearing and chewing food. When a cusp has been damaged from a cavity or fracture, the tooth needs a crown to prevent further damage.: This is a crown that only covers some of the cusps of the tooth, but not all of them. This restoration is chosen as a conservative measure to preserve as much tooth structure as possible. When conditions allow, this is the preferred type of crown restoration.: Porcelain veneers are partial crowns that cover only the front and biting edge of teeth. These all-ceramic restorations are usually placed on front teeth to change the color or shape of teeth or add symmetry and balance to a smile.  Since they are sometimes placed on crooked teeth, treatment with veneers has sometimes been referred to as instant. : This is a temporary crown that is placed on the tooth while waiting for the final crown to be made by the dental lab. Temporary crowns shouldn't be left on a tooth for very long because they are made of weak materials and cemented with weak cement that doesn't seal the tooth for very long. Occasionally, a temporary crown will purposely be left on for a prolonged period of time by the dentist to make sure it becomes free ofor other symptoms.",
"Dental Implants" : "Dental implants as we know them today were invented in 1952 by a Swedish orthopedic surgeon named Per-Ingvar Brnemark. Today, they are considered the standard of care for replacement of missing. Ais a surgical fixture that is placed into the jawbone and allowed to fuse with the bone over the span of a few months. The dental implant acts as a replacement for the root of a missing tooth. In turn, this artificial tooth root serves to hold a replacement tooth or. Having a dental implant fused to the jawbone is the closest thing to mimicking a natural tooth because it stands on its own without affecting the nearby teeth and has great stability. The process of fusion between the dental implant and jawbone is called osseointegration. Most dental implants are made of titanium, which allows them to integrate with bone without being recognized as a foreign object in our body. Over time, technology and science have progressed to greatly improve the outcomes of dental implant placement. Today, the success rate for dental implants is close to 98%.Dental implants can be used to replace a single tooth, several teeth, or all of the teeth. The goal of teeth replacement is to restore function as well as esthetics.When it comes to tooth replacement, generally, there are three options: (1) removable dental appliance (fullor partial denture), (2) fixed(cemented), and (3) dental implant. Deciding on which option to choose depends on many factors. Specifically for dental implants, these factors include:A dental surgeon examines the area to be considered for the dental implant and makes a clinical assessment of whether the patient is a good candidate for a dental implant.There are great advantages to choosing a dental implant for tooth replacement over the other options. Dental implants are conservative in that missing teeth can be replaced without affecting or altering the adjacent teeth. Furthermore, because dental implants integrate into the bone structure, they are very stable and can have the look and feel of one's own teeth.",

"Dental Sealants" : "Sealants are a thin,coating painted on the chewing surfaces ofthe back teeth (the premolars, andprevent. The painted on liquid sealant quickly bonds into the depressions and grooves of the teeth forming a protective shield over the enamel of each tooth.Although thorough brushing and flossing can remove food particles and plaque from smooth surfaces of teeth, they cannot always get into all the nooks and crannies of the back teeth to remove the food and plaque. Sealants protect these vulnerable areas from tooth decay by sealing out plaque and food.Because of the likelihood of developing decay in the depressions and groovesof the premolars and molars, children and teenagers are obvious candidates forsealants. However, adults without decay orin their molars can alsobenefit from sealants.Typically, children should get sealants on their permanent molars andpremolars as soon as these teeth come in. In this way, the dental sealants canprotect the teeth through the cavity-prone years of ages 6 to 14.In some cases, dental sealants may also be appropriate for baby teeth, suchas when a child's baby teeth have deep depressions and grooves. Because babyteeth play such an important role in holding the correct spacing for permanentteeth, it is important to keep these teeth healthy so they are not lost tooearly.Applying the sealant is a simple and painless process. It takes only a fewminutes for your dentist or hygienist to apply the sealant to seal each tooth.The application steps are as follows:Sealants can protect the teeth from decay for up to 10 years, but they needto be checked for chipping or wearing at regular dental check-ups.

A child's development can be followed by how they play, learn, speak, and behave.Skills such as taking a first step, smiling for the first time, and waving bye bye are called developmental milestones. Children reach milestones in playing, learning, speaking, behaving, and moving (crawling,, etc.). A developmental delay is when your child does not reach these milestones at the same time as other children the same age. If your child is not developing properly, there are things you can do that may help. Most of the time, a developmental problem is not something your child will grow out of on his or her own. But with help, your child could reach his or her full potential!Doctors and nurses use developmental screening to tell if children are learning basic skills when they should, or if they might have problems. Your child's doctor may ask you questions or talk and play with your child during an exam to see how he or she learns, speaks, behaves, and moves. Since there is no lab or blood test to tell if your child may have a delay, the developmental screening will help tell if your child needs to see a specialist.When a developmental delay is not recognized early, children must wait to get the help they need. This can make it hard for them to learn when they start school. In the United States, 15 percent of children have a developmental or behavioral disability such as, intellectual disability (also known as mental retardation), or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ().In addition, many children have delays in language or other areas. But, less than half of children with problems are identified before starting school.

"Dialysis" : "The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood. Dialysis is a procedure that is a substitute for many of the normal functions of the kidneys. The kidneys are two organs located on either side in the back of the abdominal cavity. Dialysis can allow individuals to live productive and useful lives, even though their kidneys no longer work adequately. Statistics from 2010 showed approximately 414,000 patients were receiving dialysis in the United States. More than an additional 179,000 patients had a functioningfor.Dialysis helps the body by performing the functions of failed kidneys. The kidney has many roles. An essential job of the kidney is to regulate the body's fluid balance. It does this by adjusting the amount of urine that is excreted on a daily basis. On hot days, the body sweats more. Thus, less water needs to be excreted through the kidneys. Ondays, the body sweats less. Thus, urine output needs to be greater in order to maintain the proper balance within the body. It is the kidney's job to regulate fluid balance by adjusting urine output.Another major duty of the kidney is to remove the waste products that the body produces throughout the day. As the body functions, cells use energy. The operation of the cells produces waste products that must be removed from the body.

When waste products accumulate they, cause a sick feeling throughout the body called uremia.",
"Discogram" : "The disc is an important structure that rests between the bony building blocks of the spine (vertebrae). The disc in the spine is sometimes referred to as the intervertebral disc. Intervertebral discs help provide flexibility to our spine. They also lessen the effect of impact on our spine by cushioning the bony vertebrae. The disc is designed somewhat like a jelly donut. The disc has a stronger outer layer (the annulus) that is rather like a radial tire and an inner gel (the nucleus) that acts as a sort of shock absorber or cushion between the bones of the spine.With injury or age, these discs can become damaged and the supporting ligaments surrounding them weaken. One of the reasons we lose height as we age is that the intervertebral discs lose their water content. This leads to shrinkage of the disc and, as a result, height diminishes.An injured disc can be a source of. A discogram is an X-ray procedure used to determine if a particular disc is the source of. Discograms are provocative tests, meaning that they attempt to reproduce a pain rather than remove a pain. The reproduction of pain during a discogram can help the doctor determine if injury to a particular disc is the source of a person's pain.During a discogram, a needle is inserted into the disc and a contrast dye is injected. This extra fluid in the disc increases the pressure in the disc. Patients with an injured disc may then experience pain that can mimic the pain they have been experiencing. The intensity of the pain is recorded on a 0-10 scale.",
"Diversion Surgery, Bowel (Bowel Diversion Surgery Ileostomy, Colostomy)" : "Bowel diversion surgery allows stool to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) theis removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any part of the small or large intestine.Some bowel diversion surgeries (those called ostomy surgery)divert the bowel to an opening in the abdomen where a stoma is created. A surgeon forms a stoma by rolling the bowel's end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. An ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect stool.Other bowel diversion surgeries reconfigure theafter damaged portions are removed. For example, after removing the colon, a surgeon can create a colon like pouch out of the last part of the small intestine, avoiding the need for an ostomy pouch.,,(), bowel obstruction, andare all possible reasons for bowel diversion surgery.Bowel diversion surgeries affect the large intestine and often the small intestine.The small intestine runs from the stomach to the large intestine and has three main sections: the duodenum, which is the first 10 inches; the jejunum, which is the middle 8; and the ileum, which is the final 12 feet. Bowel diversion surgeries only affect the ileum.The large intestine is about 5 feet long and runs from the small intestine to the anus. The colon and rectum are the two main sections of the large intestine. Semisolid digestive waste enters the colon from the small intestine. Gradually, the colon absorbs moisture and forms stool as digestive waste moves toward the rectum. The rectum is about 6 inches long and is located right before the anus. The rectum stores stool, which leaves the body through the anus. The rectum and anus control bowel movements.",
"Double Balloon Endoscopy (Balloon Endoscopy)" : "The use of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopes has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the, stomach, duodenum, and colon (). The last remaining frontier in thehas been the small intestine. Wirelessallows physicians to visualize the inside of the intestines from the esophagus through to the colon, but capsulehas limitations, the most notable of which are the inability to control the capsule's passage and to perform therapeutic interventions, such as biopsy and electrocautery. Although capsule endoscopy is likely to remain an important diagnostic procedure because of its simplicity, the limitations of capsule endoscopy have been overcome by the development of balloon endoscopy, also known as enteroscopy.There are two types of balloon endoscopy: single balloon and double balloon.For single balloon endoscopy, a 200 cm long flexible, fiberoptic, endoscope (a hose-like tube one centimeter in diameter with a light and a camera on the tip) is fitted with an equally long overtube that slides the full length of the endoscope. On the tip of the overtube is a balloon that can be inflated and deflated. The balloon is blown up to anchor the overtube within the intestine. While the overtube is anchored, the endoscope can be advanced further into the small intestine. By withdrawing the overtube the small intestine can be shortened and straightened to make the passage of the inner endoscope easier. The balloon may then be deflated so that the overtube can be inserted further and the endoscope advanced again. The endoscope itself is a standard endoscope with working channels that allow the intestine to be inflated with air, rinsed with water, or used to guide biopsy or electrocautery instruments to the tip of the endoscope.",

The most common forms of barrier contraception are:Spermicides, a form of chemical contraceptive that work by killing sperm, are often combined with barrier methods of contraception for greater effectiveness.Barrier methods of contraception generally do not have the side effects of hormonal contraceptives, and some forms of barrier contraception (contraceptive sponges and condoms) may be obtained without a prescription and easily purchased over the counter at pharmacies.The only medical contraindication to the use of barrier contraception is(when using latex condoms). However, with the exception of male and female condoms that can provide some protection against infection with sexually-transmitted diseases (), most methods of barrier contraception are not effective in preventing STDs.",
"Duodenal Biliary Drainage" : "Duodenal biliary drainage is a little-used procedure that sometimes can be helpful in diagnosing.For duodenal biliary drainage, a thinor rubber tube with several holes at its tip is passed through a patient's anesthetized nostril, down the back of the throat, through theand stomach, and into the duodenum where the bile and pancreatic ducts enter the small intestine. This is accomplished with the help of fluoroscopy, a type of X-ray. Once the tube is in place, a synthetic hormone related to cholecystokinin is injected intravenously. The hormone causes the gallbladder to contract and squeeze out its concentrated bile into the duodenum. The bile then is sucked up through the tube and examined for the presence ofand pigment particles under a microscope.A modification of duodenal biliary drainage involves collection of bile through an endoscope at the time of an upper gastrointestinal- either by() or by().Gallstones begin as microscopic particles of cholesterol or pigment that grow in size. Once the particles grow large enough to become gallstones, they can obstruct the bile ducts and cause problems. It is clear that some people who develop the symptoms and complications of gallstones --,, or- have only these microscopic particles in their gallbladders, particles too small to obstruct the bile ducts.There are two possible explanations for how obstruction might be occurring in this situation. The first is that a small gallstone obstructed the bile ducts but finally passed through the bile ducts into the intestine. The second is that the particles passing through the bile ducts irritate the ducts, causing spasm of the muscle within the walls of the ducts (which obstructs the duct) or causing inflammation of the duct so that the wall of the duct  swells (which also obstructs the duct).The risks to the patient of duodenal biliary drainage are almost nonexistent.  There have been no reports of reactions to the synthetic hormone.  Nevertheless, the presence of the tube in the throat is uncomfortable for the 30-60 minutes that are necessary to complete the test.Duodenal biliary drainage is useful in diagnosing problems related to gallstones when other tests such ashave not demonstrated gallstones but suspicion is high that gallstones are the cause of the patient's problem. Cholesterol or pigment particles without gallstones may be present in individuals who have no medical problems or problems that are not due to gallstones.  It is unclear whether these individuals ultimately are more likely to develop gallstones.  Because such individuals exist, it also is important not to assume that particles mean that gallstones are the cause of a medical problem.  The medical problem and its symptoms should be typical of the types of problems caused by gallstones.Medically reviewed by John A.

"Douche, Vaginal (Vaginal Douche (Douching))" : "Douching is the practice of washing or flushing the vagina with water or other fluids. Vaginal douches are available as prepackaged mixes, most commonly involving water mixed with vinegar, baking soda, or iodine. Douches are available at pharmacies and supermarkets.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women avoid the practice of vaginal douching. Most physicians also do not recommend douching. Douching can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the vagina and can alter the normal pH of the vagina. Changes in the composition of the bacteria that normally reside within the vagina can lead to an increased risk of vaginal infections such as yeast infections. Douching can also cause the spread of harmful bacteria further up into the reproductive tract if an infection is already present in the vagina.Women who douche state that they do so because they believe it offers health benefits, such as cleaning the vagina, rinsing away blood after menstrual periods, avoiding odor, and preventingor infections. However, these beliefs are false, and douching is not necessary to clean the vagina. Douching also does not protect against pregnancy or against sexually-transmitted diseases ().",
"Barium Enema" : "A lower GI series, also known as a barium enema, barium enema procedure, barium enema X-ray or double-contrast barium enema, is an X-ray test in which a white liquid, called barium, is infused through a catheter (tube) inserted through the anus and into the rectum until it fills the large bowel (colon). X-ray films of the colon then are taken so that the outline of the colon can be seen.    The barium enema and double contrast barium enema are used to define normal and abnormal anatomy of the colon and rectum. Colon and rectal abnormalities that can be detected include, polyps, dilation of the colon, Hirschsprung disease in infants, and colon cancers.Distention of the colon is uncomfortable, but only a few patients find it very painful. Any X-ray test procedure involves some risk of radiation exposure. The radiation exposure is minimized by standard techniques which have been developed and approved by national and international radiology committees and councils. All radiology technologists are certified by national certifying boards.Women who are or may be pregnant should notify the doctor requesting the procedure and the radiology staff, as there is a potential risk of harm to the fetus with any radiation exposure.  Complications of barium enema examination are rare.  The tip of the enema catheter or distention of the colon can penetrate the wall of the colon and give rise to a localized infection () or peritonitis (generalized infection of the abdominal cavity).  This usually occurs only when excessive pressure is used to infuse the barium or there is already a diseased colon that is weakened.",
"Baclofen Pump Therapy" : "() is a disease that causesof the brain and spinal cord, or a loss of the protective covering around nerve fibers called axons. When this occurs, the axons (the parts of the nerve cells that transmit impulses to other cells) don't work well. As more areas are affected by the loss of myelin, different symptoms develop. The specific symptoms seen inare related to the area of injury in the brain or spinal cord. Patients might experience or describe numbness, tingling, or weakness. The weakness might be mild or severe enough to cause paralysis of one side of the body. In some cases, patients may develop loss of control of their bladder or an inability to empty their bladder. Asprogresses, some patients are left with muscle spasticity, which is an involuntary painful contraction of some muscles.Spasticity is a condition in which muscles are exhibiting almost constant contracture or activity, leading to loss of range of motion, decreased function, and even. Spasticity occurs after an area of the brain or spinal cord has been injured, leading to weakness and increased tone. When an arm or leg that is affected by spasticity is moved by a health-care professional, there is involuntary resistance to that movement. Often, this spasticity is made worse when the speed (or velocity) of the movement increases. Spasticity is often seen in association with a brain injury, such as after:Baclofen is a medication that works in the brain to decrease uninhibited signals that start in an injured area of the brain and cause spasticity. By decreasing these signals, the affected muscle can relax somewhat, and the symptoms of spasticity can be reduced.When taken in pill form baclofen can be effective, but can lead to side effects such as:These side effects can limit the amount of medication that can be used to decrease the symptoms of spasticity. However, the medication can also be injected around the spinal cord, directly into the cerebral spinal fluid. When used in this way, only small amounts of the medication are needed, and side effects may be reduced.",
"Back Surgery (Minimally Invasive Lumbar Spinal Fusion)" : "The lumbar spine is the lower portion of the spine found at the center of the curve of the low back, below the rib cage. This area can be a common source of pain.is the second most common reason for visits to the family physician, behind the. As people become older, various changes occur in the lumbar spine that can cause pain. In most cases these changes are due to normal(wear of cartilage over time). The physician must also rule out other more serious conditions including, infection,(curvature of the spine),(slippage of one spinal bone on another), or fracture.Fortunately, most patients withwill have improvement in their symptoms regardless of treatment within six weeks. During that time the physician has various treatment options including medications, physical therapy, or injections that can help ease the symptoms. Some of those patients that do not improve after six to 12 weeks may be candidates for surgery. The spine surgeon has different types of surgical options available based on the specific cause of pain.Lumbar spinal fusion is an operation that causes the vertebrae (bones of the spine) in the lower back to grow together. The goal of the lumbar fusion is to have the two vertebrae fuse (grow solidly together) so that there is no longer any motion between them. Removing the intervertebral disc (cushion between the bones) orcan reduce some of the pressure on the nerves, helping to reduce pain. Additionally, by fusing the two vertebrae together, this may stop the formation of bone spurs at that location, further reducing pain and potential nerve injury.There are many different specific techniques to try to fuse the vertebrae together. The surgery can be performed either through an incision in the back, the abdomen, or a combination of both. In many cases metal screws and rods are placed from the back into the bones to hold them in position while the fusion occurs. During an interbody fusion, the surgeon removes the intervertebral disc and places either a bone graft or a metal orcage, or a combination of these in its place. The decision on what type of fusion is best for each patient is based on their specific complaints and the cause of symptoms. Spinal fusion can be very effective in the properly selected patient.",
"Barium Swallow (Upper GI Series)" : "An upper gastrointestinal (GI) series (barium swallow), is a radiological test that is used to visualize the structures of the upper- the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. (If visualization of the remaining parts of the small intestine is necessary, a small bowel follow through can be added to the test.) These structures are observed during the examination, and the images are also saved for further review on X-ray film or as digital images. An upper GI series can reveal conditions such as ulcers, tumors, hiatal hernias, scarring, blockages, and abnormalities of the muscular wall of the gastrointestinal tissues.Any x-ray test procedure involves some risk fromexposure.

"Bicarbonate (Electrolytes)" : "Chemically, electrolytes are substances that become ions in solution and acquire the capacity to conduct electricity. Electrolytes are present in the, and the balance of the electrolytes in our bodies is essential for normal function of our cells and our organs.Common electrolytes that are measured by doctors with blood testing include sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The functions and normal range values for these electrolytes are described below.Sodium is the major positive ion (cation) in fluid outside of cells. The chemical notation for sodium is Na+. When combined with chloride, the resulting substance is table salt. Excess sodium (such as that obtained from dietary sources) is excreted in the urine. Sodium regulates the total amount of water in the body and the transmission of sodium into and out of individual cells also plays a role in critical body functions. Many processes in the body, especially in the brain, nervous system, and muscles, require electrical signals for communication. The movement of sodium is critical in the generation of these electrical signals. Therefore, too much or too little sodium can cause cells to malfunction, and extremes in the blood sodium levels (too much or too little) can be fatal.A Normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).",

Biological therapy is also used to protect the body from some of the side effects of certain treatments.Biological therapy often involves the use of substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces these substances in small amounts in response to infection and disease. Using modern laboratory techniques, scientists can produce BRMs in large amounts for use in the treatment ofand other diseases, such asand.Biological therapy may also target specific molecules oncells to destroy the cells, or it may target proteins that facilitate the growth of cancer cells.Depending on the agent, biological therapies can be given by mouth, intravenously, or as an injection.",

"Biopsy Of Cervix (Colposcopy)" : "Colposcopy is a gynecological procedure that illuminates and magnifies the vulva, vaginal walls, and uterine cervix in order to detect and examine abnormalities of these structures. The cervix is the base of the womb (uterus) and leads out to the birth canal (vagina). During colposcopy, special tests [acetic acid wash, use of color filters, and sampling (biopsy) of tissues] can be done. Colposcopy is not to be confused with culdoscopy, which is the insertion of an instrument through the wall of the vagina in order to view the pelvic area behind the vagina.Colposcopy is usually done in one of two circumstances: to examine the cervix either when the result of a Pap smear is abnormal, or when the cervix looks abnormal during the collection of a Pap smear. Even if a Pap smear result is normal, colposcopy is sometimes necessary when the cervix appears visibly abnormal to the clinician performing the Pap smear. The purpose of the colposcopy is to determine what is causing the abnormal looking cervix or the abnormal Pap smear so that appropriate treatment can be given.A colposcope is a microscope that resembles a pair of binoculars. The instrument has a range of magnification lenses. It also has color filters that allow the physician to detect tiny abnormal blood vessels on the cervix. The colposcope is used to examine the vaginal walls and cervix through the vaginal opening.Colposcopy is a safe procedure with no complications other than vaginal spotting of blood.The examiner wants to get a good look at the squamocolumnar junction, which is the area of the cervix that gives rise to most cases of. The term squamocolumnar junction refers to the border between the two different types of cells (squamous cells that line the outer surface of the cervix and columnar cells that normally form the lining of the endocervical canal). The endocervical canal connects the cervix with the main part of the uterus. Most cases of cervical cancer originate from the squamous cells and, therefore, are referred to as squamous cell cervical cancer.During colposcopy, the entire squamocolumnar junction is more likely to be seen in young women. The reason for this is that after, the squamocolumnar junction tends to migrate inside the endocervical canal. Colposcopy, therefore, is occasionally not adequate in women after. Therefore, if the whole squamocolumnar junction area of the cervix is not visible on colposcopy, another type of procedure may need to be performed that allows the entire squamocolumnar junction to be examined.

This eventually leads to an increase in heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dry, swelling in the ankles or legs, weight gain, increased urination,, or rapid or irregular heartbeat.Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), also called biventricular pacing, uses a special kind of pacemaker, called a biventricular pacemaker, designed to treat the delay incontractions. It keeps the right and left ventricles pumping together by sending small electrical impulses through the leads. This therapy has been shown to improve the symptoms of heart failure and the person's overall quality of life.Leads are implanted through a vein into theand into the coronary sinus vein to pace or regulate the left ventricle. Usually (but not always), a lead is also implanted into the. This helps the heart beat in a more balanced way.Traditional pacemakers are used to treat slow heart rhythms. Pacemakers regulate the rightand right ventricle to maintain a good heart rate and keep the atrium and ventricle working together. This is called AV synchrony.

The two most important thyroid hormones are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which account for 99.9% and 0.1% of thyroid hormones present in the blood respectively. However, the hormone with the most biological activity is T3. Once released from the thyroid gland into the blood, a large amount of T4 is converted into T3 - the active hormone that affects theof cells.",
"ECG (Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG))" : "The electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a noninvasive test that is used toreflect underlying heart conditions by measuring the electrical activity of theheart. By positioning leads (electrical sensing devices) on the body instandardized locations, information about many heart conditions can be learnedby looking for characteristic patterns on the EKG.EKG leads are attached to the body while the patient lies flat on a bed ortable. Leads are attached to each extremity (four total) and to six pre-definedpositions on the front of the chest. A small amount of gel is applied to theskin, which allows the electrical impulses of the heart to be more easilytransmitted to the EKG leads. The leads are attached by small suction cups,Velcro straps, or by small adhesive patches attached loosely to the skin. Thetest takes about five minutes and is painless. In some instances, men may requirethe shaving of a small amount of chest hair to obtain optimal contact betweenthe leads and the skin.",
"Echo (Echocardiogram)" : "The heart is a two-stage electrical pump that circulates blood throughout the body. The anatomy includes four chambers and four valves. For the heart to function normally these structures need to be intact and theneeds to beat in a coordinated fashion, so that blood flows in and out of each chamber in the proper direction.An echocardiogram (echo=sound + card=heart + gram=drawing) is antest that can evaluate the structures of the heart, as well as the direction of blood flow within it. Technicians specially trained inproduce the images and videos, often using a special probe or transducer that is placed in various places on the chest wall, to view the heart from different directions. Cardiologists, or heart specialists, are trained to evaluate these images to assess heart function and provide a report of the results.The echocardiogram is just one of the many tests that can be done to evaluate heart anatomy and function.An(,) is the most common heart tracing done. Electrodes are placed on the chest wall and collect information about the electrical activity of the heart. Aside from the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat, the EKG can provide indirect evidence of blood flow within arteries to heart muscle and  the thickness of heart muscle.is an invasive test performed by a cardiologist, where a catheter is threaded into the(those arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood) through the femoral artery in the groin, the radial artery in the wrist, or the brachial artery in the elbow. Dye is injected into the coronary arteries looking for blockage. In some instances, the blockage can be corrected bywhere a balloon is inflated at the level of blockage, re-establishing blood flow. Acan be used to keep the artery open. This test can also assess the size and function of the heart chambers and valves, and the major arteries and veins that enter and leave the heart.",
"Echogram (Ultrasound)" : "While the patient's history and physical examination are the initial steps of making a medical diagnosis, the ability to peer inside the body can be a powerful tool. Ultrasound is an imaging technique that provides that ability to medical practitioners.Ultrasound produces sound waves that are beamed into the body causing return echoes that are recorded to visualize structures beneath the skin. The ability to measure different echoes reflected from a variety of tissues allows a shadow picture to be constructed. The technology is especially accurate at seeing the interface between solid and fluid filled spaces. These are actually the same principles that allow SONAR on boats to see the bottom of the ocean.Ultrasonography is a form of body imaging using sound waves to facilitate makeing a medical diagnosis. A skilled ultrasound technician is able to see inside the body using ultrasonography to answer questions that may be asked by the medical practitioner caring for the patient. Usually, a radiologist will oversee the ultrasound test and report on the results, but other types of physicians may also use ultrasound as a diagnostic tool. For example, obstetricians use ultrasound to assess the fetus during. Surgeons and emergency physicians use ultrasound at the bedside to assessor other concerns.A transducer, or probe, is used to project and receive the sound waves and their echoes. A gel is wiped onto the patient's skin so that the sound waves are not distorted as they cross through the skin. Using their understanding of human anatomy and the machine, the technician can evaluate specific structures and try to answer the question asked by the patient's physician. This may take a fair amount of time and require the probe to be repositioned and pointed in different directions. As well, the technician may need to vary the amount of pressure used to push the probe into the skin. The goal will be to paint a shadow picture of the inner organ that the health care practitioner has asked to be visualized.The physics of sound can place limits on the test. The quality of the picture depends on many factors.Ultrasound can be enhanced by using Doppler technology which can measure whether an object is moving towards or away from the probe. This can allow the technician to measure blood flow in organs such as the heart or, or within specific blood vessels.",
"ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy)" : "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a non-medication medical treatment that is used to address severe psychiatric symptoms, after trials of medications andhave been unsuccessful or adisorder is determined to be acute enough to warrant this intervention. During the ECT procedure, an electric current is passed through the patient's brain to produce controlled convulsions () while the person is sedated using general anesthesia. This device is often used in a hospital but can be done on an outpatient basis (the individual receiving the treatment does not stay overnight in the hospital).Formerly called electroshock therapy, ECT is a form of mental health therapy that was based on a procedure in whichwere chemically induced in patients using a heart medication. It was first done in 1934 in Hungary to treat. In 1938, it is thought that electrical currents delivered directly to the brain were first used to induce seizures to treat. That was reportedly performed by Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti. By 1940, ECT was being used in psychiatry in the United States. The U.S. military often used ECT during World War II, after which it became widely used in American and European psychiatric hospitals. It was in the late 1940s that doctors started placing electrodes on one side of the brain (unilaterally) rather than both sides (bilaterally), which resulted in less side effects likeor speech problems.Despite those advances, ECT fell out of favor for at least a generation in psychiatry, starting in the 1960s. Rather than the popularity of psychoanalysis or the rise of medication treatments from pharmaceutical companies, it is thought that a cultural bias against psychiatry in general and against ECT specifically is the reason that this highly effective medical treatment became controversial. Novels likein 1961 andin 1962, as well as the film based on the latter novel, released in 1975, are thought to have fueled some of that backlash. The antipsychiatry stance of groups like the Church of Scientology is also thought to have contributed to the stigma that mental health treatments, particularly ECT, incurred during that period of time.Appreciation of the effectiveness of ECT started regaining ground in psychiatry during the mid-1980s with the publication of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference on Electroconvulsive Therapy, published in the(), which documented how well this medical treatment improves symptoms of. By the mid-1990s, several guidelines for conducting ECT were published, providing predictability, standardizing, and thus credibility of this medical treatment in providing care for severe mental health disorders.",

But when the hair is the wrong partof yourwoman's upper lip or chin or bikini line, formay beconsidering electrolysis.Since many factors influence hair growth, you will need to return forseveral electrolysis visits. The total number of sessions needed to remove hair permanentlyfrom a particular area will vary from person to person. Most clients returnonce a week or every other week, as necessary. But the unwanted hair will begone forever once the series of treatments have been completed. Each treatmentlasts between 15 minutes and one hour.Electrolysis is painful. The truth is, electrolysis usually does not causemuch discomfort. Modern electrolysis methods have reduced the discomfort to amere tingling. A topical anesthetic may be used in some cases.The electric tweezer method is permanent. The truth is, the Food and DrugAdministration and the American Medical Association recognize only electrolysisas a permanent method of removing hair. In fact, some states prohibit those whouse the electriccan also be purchased for consumerclaiming it provides permanent hair removal.Temporary methods of hair removal can be better. Chemicaldepilatories (liquids or creams) are often used to remove body hair. Theseproducts contain irritating chemicals, and can be time-consuming and messy.Likewise, bleaches contain harsh chemicals and do little to disguise dark hair.They may also discolor the skin. Waxing is another temporary method of hairremoval and is usually done in salons. A hot wax is applied to the skin andremoved once it has dried over the hair. The hair is stripped off when the waxis removed. Waxing can be painful and costly. Home waxing kits are available,but they can be difficult to use and messy. There are electrical electrolysisdevices available for home use that try to copy the devices used byprofessionals. These devices are often unsafe for use by anyone who is nottrained in electrolysis. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",
"EEG - Electroencephalogram" : "An EEG, or electroencephalogram, is a test that can help diagnose. During an EEG, the electrical signals of the brain are recorded. This electrical activity is detected by electrodes, or sensors, placed on the patient'sand transmitted to a polygraph that records the activity.Electrical signals produced by the brain neurons are picked up by the electrodes and transmitted to a polygraph, where they produce separate graphs on moving paper using an ink writing pen or on a computer screen.To prepare for your EEG you should:Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor prior to your procedure.Wash your hair the night before the test. Do not use hair cream, oils, or spray afterward.During an EEG, you lie down on the examining table or bed while about 20 electrodes are attached to your scalp. You are asked to relax and lie first with your eyes open, then later with them closed. You may be asked to breathe deeply and rapidly or to stare at a flashing light -- both of these activities produce changes in the brain-wave patterns. If you are prone to, it is rare that you may experience one during the test. If you are being evaluated for adisorder, EEG may be performed continuously during the night while you are asleep. Such a recording, which may involve an evaluation of other body functions during, such asand pulse, is referred to as polysomnography.When the EEG is done, the electrodes are removed and the glue that held them in place is washed away with acetone. You may have to use additional acetone at home to completely remove the glue. Unless you are actively havingor are restricted by your doctor, you may drive home. If the EEG was performed overnight, you should arrange to have someone drive you home. If you stopped taking anticonvulsant drugs for the EEG, you can usually start taking them again.A neurologist examines the EEG recording for abnormalities in the brain-wave pattern, which may reflect diseases of the nervous system.SOURCES:Reviewed by Jon Glass on September 16, 2009 2005-2017.

"EGG (Electrogastrogram)" : "An electrogastrogram is similar to an() of the heart.  It is a recording of the electrical signals that travel through the muscles of the stomach and control the muscles' contraction.An electrogastrogram is used when there is a suspicion that the muscles of the stomach or the nerves controlling those muscles are not working normally. Usually this suspicion arises when there is a problem with recurrentand, signs that the stomach is not emptying food normally. If the electrogastrogram is abnormal, it confirms that the problem probably is with the stomach's muscles or the nerves that control the muscles. The electrogastrogram can be considered an experimental procedure since its exact role in the diagnosis of diseases of the stomach has not been defined yet.For an electrogastrogram, several electrodes are taped onto the abdomen over the stomach in the same manner as electrodes are placed on the chest for an electrocardiogram. The electrodes sense the electrical signals coming from the stomach's muscles, and the signals are recorded on a computer for analysis. Recordings are made both fasting and after a meal with the patient lying quietly. The study takes two or three hours.In normal individuals there is a regular electrical rhythm generated by the muscles of the stomach--just as in the heart--and the power (voltage) of the electrical current increases after the meal.  In patients with abnormalities of the muscles or nerves of the stomach, the rhythm often is irregular or there is no post-meal increase in electrical power.There are no side effects.  The study is painless.No, there are no alternatives to this study. Other studies, however, for example, antro-duodenal motility studies or gastric emptying studies may give additional information since abnormal electrical activity of the stomach often results in abnormal muscular activity and reduced or delayed emptying of food from the stomach.Medically reviewed by John A.

"Electromyogram" : "An electromyogram (EMG) is a test that is used to record the electrical activity of muscles. When muscles are active, they produce an electrical current. This current is usually proportional to the level of the muscle activity. An EMG is also referred to as a myogram.EMGs can be used to detect abnormal electrical activity of muscle that can occur in many diseases and conditions, including muscular dystrophy, inflammation of muscles, pinched nerves, peripheral nerve damage (damage to nerves in the arms and legs),(),, disc herniation, and others.An EMG is often performed when patients have unexplained muscle weakness. The EMG helps to distinguish between muscle conditions in which the problem begins in the muscle and muscle weakness due to nerve disorders. The EMG can also be used to detect true weakness, as opposed to weakness from reduced use because ofor lack of motivation. EMGs can also be used to isolate the level of nerve irritation or injury.A needle is inserted through the skin into the muscle. The electrical activity is detected by this needle (which serves as an electrode). The activity is displayed visually on an oscilloscope and may also be detected audibly with a speaker.Since skeletal muscles are often large, several needle electrodes may need to be placed at various locations to obtain an informative EMG.After placement of the electrode(s), the patient may be asked to contract the muscle (for example, to bend the leg).The presence, size, and shape of the wave form (the action potential) produced on the oscilloscope provide information about the ability of the muscle to respond to nervous stimulation. Each musclethat contracts  produces an action potential. The size of the muscle fiber affects the rate (how frequently an action potential occurs) and the size (the amplitude) of the action potential.",

"Electroretinography" : "Electroretinography (ERG) is an eye test used to detect abnormal function of the(the light-detecting portion of the eye). Specifically, in this test, the light-sensitive cells of the eye, the rods and cones, and their connectingcells in the retina are examined. During the test, an electrode is placed on the(at the front of the eye) to measure the electrical responses to light of the cells that sense light in the retina at the back of the eye.The patient assumes a comfortable position (lying down or sitting up). Usually the patient's eyes are dilated beforehand with standard dilating eye drops. Anesthetic drops are then placed in the eyes, causing them to become numb. The eyelids are then propped open with a speculum, and an electrode is gently placed on each eye with a device very similar to a contact. An additional electrode is placed on the skin to provide a ground for the very faint electrical signals produced by the retina.During an ERG recording session, the patient watches a standardized light stimulus, and the resulting signal is interpreted in terms of its amplitude (voltage) and time course. This test can even be performed in cooperative children, as well as sedated or anesthetized infants. The visual stimuli include flashes, called a flash ERG, and reversing checkerboard patterns, known as a pattern ERG.The electrodes measure the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. The information that comes from each electrode is transmitted to a monitor where it is displayed as two types of waves, labeled the A waves and B waves.Readings during electroretinography are usually taken first in normal room light. The lights are then dimmed for 20 minutes, and readings are again taken while a white light is shined into the eyes. The final readings are taken as a bright flash is directed toward the eyes.An ERG is useful in evaluating both inherited (hereditary) and acquired disorders of the retina. An ERG can also be useful in determining if retinal surgery or other types ofsurgery such asextraction might be useful.",

"Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP)" : "Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a diagnostic test to examine:The procedure is performed by using a long, flexible, viewing instrument (a duodenoscope) about the diameter of a pen. The duodenoscope can be directed and moved around the many bends of the stomach and duodenum. The modern duodenoscope uses a thin-optic bundle to transmit light to the tip of the endoscope, and a thin wire with a chip also at the tip of the endoscope to transmit digital video images to a TV screen. The duodenoscope is inserted through the mouth, through the back of the throat, down the food pipe (), through the stomach and into the duodenum. Once the papilla of Vater is identified, a smallcatheter (cannula) is passed through an open channel of the endoscope into the opening of the papilla, and into the bile ducts and/or the pancreatic duct. Contrast material (dye) is then injected and X-rays are taken of the bile ducts and the pancreatic duct. Another open channel in the endoscope also allows other instruments to be passed through it in order to perform biopsies, to insert plastic or metal stents or tubing to relieve obstruction of the bile ducts or pancreatic duct caused byor scarring, and to perform incisions by using electrocautery (electric heat).The liver is a large solid organ located beneath the right. The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder (a small sac located beneath the liver). After meals, the gallbladder contracts and empties the bile through the cystic duct, into the bile ducts, through the papilla of Vater, and into the intestine to help with. The pancreas is located behind the stomach. It produces a digestive juice that drains through the pancreatic duct--which usually joins the bile duct within the papilla,--and then enters the intestine.An important procedure related to ERCP is endoscopicwhich uses a similar endoscope that, in addition to the camera, has an ultrasound probe on its tip to examine the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreatic duct, and pancreas ultrasonographically. Ultrasonographically-directed needle biopsies of the pancreas can be taken through a channel in the endoscope.A second, newer procedure related to ERCP is the use of miniature endoscopes that are passed through the operating channel of a duodenoscope and can be inserted directly into the bile and pancreatic ducts. The inside of the ducts can be visualized, and directed biopsies can be taken. Other therapeutic interventions also are possible.",
"Endoscopic Ultrasound" : "Endoscopic(EUS) combinesand ultrasound in order to obtain images and information about the digestive tract and the surrounding tissue and organs. Endoscopy refers to the procedure of inserting a long flexible tube via the mouth or the rectum to visualize the digestive tract (for further information, please visit theandarticles),  whereas ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of the organs and structures inside the body such as ovaries, uterus,, gallbladder, pancreas, or.Traditional ultrasound sends sound waves to the organ(s) and back with a transducer placed on the skin overlying the organ(s) of interest. Images obtained by traditional ultrasound are not always of high quality.  In EUS a small ultrasound transducer is installed on the tip of the endoscope. By inserting the endoscope into the upper or the lower digestive tract one can obtain high quality ultrasound images of the organs inside the body.Placing the transducer on the tip of an endoscope allows the transducer to get close to the organs inside the body.  Because of the proximity of the EUS transducer to the organ(s) of interest, the images obtained are frequently more accurate and more detailed than the ones obtained by traditional ultrasound.  The EUS also can obtain information about the layers of the intestinal wall as well as adjacent areas such asand the blood vessels.Other uses of EUS include studying the flow of blood inside blood vessels using Doppler ultrasound, and to obtain tissue samples by passing a special needle, under ultrasound guidance, into enlarged lymph nodes or suspicious tumors.  The tissue or cells obtained by the needle can be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. The process of obtaining tissue with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).",
"Endometrial Biopsy" : "The uterus (womb) is lined by a special type of tissue known as the. Endometrial biopsy, or endometrial sampling, is a technique of removing a piece of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus. The sample of tissue is analyzed under a microscope in the laboratory by a pathologist, a doctor with special training in diagnosis of diseases based upon tissue examination.An endometrial biopsy is most often performed to help determine the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. It can also be done to help evaluate the cause of, test for uterine infections, and even monitor the response to certain medications.Endometrial biopsy has many advantages over the more complicated procedure known as(D&C), which is a more extensive removal of the uterine lining that requires dilation (stretching) of the cervical opening with special instruments. Unlike D&C, endometrial biopsy may be performed in the doctor's office and typically does not require anesthesia or hospitalization.Endometrial biopsy cannot be performed during, and sometimes may not be recommended when certain other conditions are present, includingor abnormal narrowing (stenosis) of the cervical opening.Endometrial biopsy is most often done in the physician's office, but it can be performed on women in the hospital. The patient lies on the examining table in a position similar to that used for obtaining Pap smears. The doctor uses a speculum to open the vaginal canal and visualize the cervix, the opening to the uterus. During endometrial biopsy the doctor inserts a thinor metal tubular device through the cervix into the uterus to remove a tiny piece of the inner lining tissue.Usually no anesthesia is required, but taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure can help reduce cramping and. In some cases, a small amount of lidocaine anesthetic is inserted into the uterine cavity to minimize discomfort.There are very few risks with endometrial biopsy. The leading risk isor cramping, but this typically subsides rapidly following the procedure. Other less common risks are feeling faint or light-headed, possible infection, bleeding, and rarely, perforation of the uterus.Medically reviewed by Wayne Blocker, MD; Board Certified Obstetrics and GynecologyREFERENCE:Endometrial sampling procedures.

Additional procedures that may be necessary to achieve the best results include: necklift,(),, autologous fat injection, removal of buccal (cheek) fat pad, forehead lift, browlift, chemical or laser peel, and malar (cheek), submalar or.A traditional facelift procedure is performed through an incision starting in the hair or hairline above and in front of the ear (the temporal region).  The incision is extended downward in front of the ear, comes under the ear and then upward behind the ear ending in the hair or hairline behind the ear. The skin and fatty tissues are then lifted off the underlying muscle and fascia (connective tissue) as far forward as is necessary to correct the loose skin problem.  The underlying muscle and fascia can be tightened withif the surgeon feels it is necessary. The skin is pulled back and upward and the excess skin removed. Theis then closed with sutures and skin staples. Some surgeons leave a drain in the wounds to remove excess blood. Bandages are then applied.  There are surgical techniques which go into deeper tissues rather than under the skin and fat.

This is usually done as a lifesaving maneuver to replace blood cells or blood products lost through severe bleeding, during surgery when blood loss occurs or to increase the blood count in anpatient. The following material is provided to all patients and/or their family members regarding blood transfusions and the use of blood products. Although in most situations the likelihood of a blood transfusion associated with surgery is uncommon, at times patients may require blood products. You are encouraged to discuss your particular need for transfusion as well as the risks of transfusion with your doctor.Your options may be limited by time and health factors, so it is important to begin carrying out your decision as soon as possible. For example, if friends or family members are donating blood for a patient (directed donors), their blood should be drawn several days prior to the anticipated need to allow adequate time for testing and labeling. The exact protocols are hospital and donor site specific.The safest blood product is your own, so if a transfusion is likely, this is your lowest risk choice. Unfortunately this option is usually only practical when preparing for elective surgery. In most other instances the patient cannot donate their own blood due to the acute nature of the need for blood. Although you have the right to refuse a blood transfusion, this decision may have life-threatening consequences. If you are a parent deciding for your child, you as the parent or guardian must understand that in a life-threatening situation your doctors will act in your child's best interest to insure your child's health and wellbeing in accordance with standards of medical care regardless of religious beliefs. Please carefully review this material and decide with your doctor which option(s) you prefer, understanding that your doctor will always act in the best interest of his or her patient.To assure a safe transfusion make sure your healthcare provider who starts the transfusion verifies your name and matches it to the blood that is going to be transfused. Besides your name, a second personal identifier usually used is your birthday. This assures the blood is given to the correct patient.If during the transfusion you have symptoms of shortness of breath,,or chills or just not feeling well, alert the person transfusing the blood immediately.Blood can be provided from two sources:(using your own blood) or(using someone else's blood).donating your own blood before surgery. The blood bank draws your blood and stores it until you need it during or after surgery. This option is only for non-emergency (elective) surgery. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during and after surgery. The disadvantage is that it requires advanced planning which may delay surgery. Some medical conditions may prevent the pre-operative donation of blood products.recycling your blood during surgery. Blood lost during surgery is filtered, and put back into your body during surgery. This can be done in emergency and elective surgeries. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during surgery. Large amounts of blood can be recycled.

This process can't be used in patients whereor infection is present.donating your own blood during surgery. Immediately before surgery, some of your blood is taken and replaced with IV fluids. After surgery, your blood is filtered and returned to you. This is done only for elective surgeries. This process dilutes your own blood so you lose less concentrated blood during surgery. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during surgery. The disadvantage of this process is that only a limited amount of blood can be removed, and certain medical conditions may prevent the use of this technique.donating your own platelets and plasma. Before surgery, your platelets and plasma, which help stop bleeding, are withdrawn, filtered and returned to you when you need it later. This can be done only for elective surgeries.

Examples of the uses of an ELISA test includes to diagnose infections such as() and somediseases like food. ELISA tests are also known as an immunosorbent assay.ELISA tests are primarily used for the detection of proteins (as opposed to small molecules and ions such as glucose and potassium). The substances detected by ELISA tests can include hormones, viral antigens (, for example), bacterial antigens (, for example), and antibodies that the body has made in response to infection (antibodies to, for example) or vaccination.An ELISA kit is a commercially available ELISA test that usually contains pre-coated polystyrene plates, detection antibodies, and usually all of the chemicals needed to perform an ELISA test. However, special kits can be purchased with substances designated by the customer.Health care personnel who perform the test are trained laboratory technicians who use special kits that measure the antigens' interactions with the antibodies in the kit. They will inform your doctor of the test results.There are variations of the ELISA test (see below), but the most utilized type consists of an antibody attached to a solid surface (polystyrene plate). This antibody has affinity for (will latch on to) the substance of interest, such as a hormone, bacteria, or another antibody. For example, human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HCG), the commonly measured protein which indicates, can be detected by ELISA. A mixture of purified HCG linked to an enzyme and the test sample (blood or urine) are added to the test system. If no HCG is present in the test sample, then only the linked enzyme will bind to the solid surface. The more substance of interest that is present in the test sample, the less linked enzyme will bind to the solid surface. The more of the substance of interest is present it will cause a reaction and show up on the test plate in some way, such as a change in color of the solution (or like atwo pink lines or a + mark).",
"Fecal Occult Blood Tests" : "Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is testing that is performed on samples of stool in order to detect occult blood (blood that is not visible to the naked eye) in otherwise normal-colored stool. Fecal occult blood usually is a result of slow (often intermittent) bleeding from inside the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. The slow bleed does not change the color of the stool or result in visible bright red blood. Therefore, the blood is found only by testing the stool for blood in the laboratory. Occult bleeding has many of the same causes as other forms of more rapid gastrointestinal bleeding, such as(passage of red blood and/orrectally) and melena (black tarry stool as a result of bleeding from the uppersuch as ulcers). Please read the Rectal Bleeding article for a more detailed explanation of different patterns of gastrointestinal bleeding.A fecal occult blood test is done primarily to detectin people without intestinal symptoms. Cancers of the colon are common and frequently produce fecal occult blood long before they cause other symptoms such as, rectal bleeding, or changes in bowel habits. In addition, some precursors of colon, specifically, some types of, also may bleed slowly and cause fecal occult blood. By finding the cancers early through fecal occult blood testing when the cancers are small and before they(spread to distant organs), patients may be cured of their cancers by removing them surgically. By removingpolyps that are found through fecal occult blood testing,may be prevented.",
"Flexible Sigmoidoscopy" : "Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to examine the rectum and the lower (sigmoid) colon. The flexible sigmoidoscope is a flexible tube 60 cm long and about the thickness of your little finger.  It is inserted gently into the anus and advanced slowly into the rectum and the lower colon. It is an accurate and simple method of investigating the cause of, change in bowel habit, and rectal symptoms such asand.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy also is a part of colon screening and surveillance for.In order to obtain accurate results, the rectum and the lower colon must be completely clean of stool. Your doctor will give you detailed instructions on how to cleanse your colon. In general, this requires the use of one or two enemas prior to the procedure and may also call for a laxative and some dietary modifications. Under special circumstances, such as the presence of significant, the preparation may be waived.In general, you can continue to take your regular medicines. You should, however, inform your doctor of all the prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking as well as anyyou may have. Certain drugs increase the risk of bleeding if biopsies are performed; these include aspirin, blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), and NSAIDs such as Motrin and Advil. Your doctor may ask you to stop these medications for several days before the procedure. You should also alert your doctor if you have anvalve, hip or knee prosthesis, or have a disease of thesuch as mitral stenosis,, or.

Like many things, the thyroid gland gets lumpier as we get older and the frequency of these nodules increases with age. In fact, many are found incidentally during routine examinations or radiology testing. Thyroid nodules are also more common in women than in men. Interestingly, because women have so many more nodules than men, the incidence of detectedis higher in women than in men by virtue of absolute numbers. However, each individual nodule is more likely to be cancerous if found in a man.Doctors always hold a degree of concern whenever a new growth is detected on the body, regardless of the tissue involved. The concern is whether or not the growth or nodule is cancer. Fortunately, fewer than 10% of thyroid nodules are malignant. The majority of thyroid nodules are harmless growths, known as adenomas, and are contained within a capsule. Even though cancerous nodules are uncommon, the doctor will take the necessary  measures to be certain.",

"Fallopian Tube Removal (Hysterectomy)" : "A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for. Other common reasons are:Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.(also known as uterine leiomyomata) are by far the most common reason a hysterectomy is performed.are benign growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the vast majority are benign, meaning they do not cause or turn into, uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Indications for hysterectomy in cases of uterine fibroids are excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month), pressure or, and/or bleeding severe enough to produce. Pelvic relaxation is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. In second degree prolapse, the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening, and in third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy. A vaginal wall weakness such as a, rectocele, or urethrocele, can lead to symptoms such as(unintentional loss of urine), pelvic heaviness, and impaired sexual performance. Urine loss tends to be aggravated by sneezing,, jumping, or laughing. Childbearing is the most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation, though there may be other causes. Avoidance of vaginal birth and having a caesarean section doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation.A hysterectomy is also performed to treator very severe pre-cancers (called dysplasia,, or CIN III, or microinvasiveof the cervix). A hysterectomy for(uterine lining cancer) has an obvious purpose, that of removal of the cancer from the body. This procedure is the foundation of treatment for.",
"Freeze Nerves (Cryotherapy)" : "Cryotherapy is atreatment that uses a method of localized freezing temperatures to deaden an irritated nerve. Cryotherapy is also used as a method of treating localized areas of some cancers (called cryosurgery), such asand to treat abnormal skin cells by dermatologists. In this article we only discuss its use in nerve conditions.In cryotherapy, a probe is inserted into the tissue next to the affected nerve. The temperature of the probe drops to then effectively freeze the nerve. The freezing inactivates the nerve and, as a result, painful nerve irritation is relieved. Cryotherapy is a relatively safe and effective means of treating localized nerve irritation.Cryotherapy can be used to treat conditions that involve irritation of an isolated nerve. In general, such conditions include benign nerve growths (neuromas) and pinched nerves (nerve entrapments). Specific examples include nerve irritation between the ribs (intercostal neuralgia), cluneal, ilioinguinal neuroma, hypogastric neuromas, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment, and interdigital neuromas. Many forms of nerve entrapment can often be treated with cryotherapy.While cryotherapy can reduce unwanted nerve irritation, it sometimes can leave the tissue affected with unusual sensations, such as numbness or tingling, or with redness and irritation of the skin. These effects are generally temporary.Cryotherapy procedures are usually performed in the doctor's office.Medically reviewed by Joseph Carcione, DO; American board of Psychiatry and NeurologyREFERENCE:Goldstein, Beth G., MD.

"Flu Vaccination" : "The flu (or common flu) is a viral infection that is spread from person to person in secretions of the nose and, for example when sneezing. Medically, the common flu is referred to as. Flu is a respiratory infection, that is, an infection that develops primarily in the lungs. Respiratory infections caused by other viruses often are called flu, but this is incorrect. Influenza usually causes higher, more malaise, and severe bodythan other respiratory infections. Although other viruses may cause these symptoms, they do so less frequently.Influenza viruses are divided scientifically into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter. Influenza type C usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public-health impact of influenza types A and B. Type A viruses are divided into subtypes and are named based on differences in two viral surface proteins called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 16 known H subtypes and nine known N subtypes.The flu is a common illness. Every year in the United States, on averageThe so-calledpandemic of 2009 was caused by a novel influenza A virus designatedbased upon its surface protein types. This virus was originally referred to as swine flu because many of the genes in this new virus were very similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. However, this virus was actually quite different from the typical swine flu viruses found in pigs. The novel H1N1 virus first caused illness in Mexico and the United States in March and April 2009.",

"Bone Marrow" : "The soft spongy tissue in the center of bones is the bone marrow. The bone marrow contains the different types of cells () that give rise to the, white cells, and platelets found in our blood. The marrow may also contain abnormal cells, proteins, or inflammatory reactions that are not normally present, such ascells in some individuals. Since the production of red cells requires iron, the marrow is one of the places in the body that normally stores a supply of iron. When we are younger, our bone marrow contains very little fat. As we age, the percentage of fat in our marrow increases.A bone marrow procedure (commonly referred to as a bone marrow or bone marrow aspiration with or without biopsy or trephination) is a technique used to obtain a sample of the blood-forming portion (marrow) of the inner core of bone for examination in the laboratory or for transplantation. A bone marrow aspiration consists of inserting a special needle into a bone and withdrawing the marrow by suction. A bone marrow biopsy takes out a larger piece of the bone marrow by coring out a sample of the marrow.In general, internists, hematologists, oncologists, and transplant specialists are the doctors that usually perform bone marrow aspirates and/or biopsies.Most bone marrow aspirations are performed to diagnose various conditions that affect the different types of blood cells. Abnormal blood counts can lead a doctor to suspect that there may be a problem in the bone marrow. Another frequent purpose of a bone marrow is to diagnose certain cancers or to determine the extent of a(cancer staging) that is present within the bone marrow. Bone marrow procedures can also detect uncommon conditions, both cancerous and noncancerous, including abnormal proteins (such as in), inflammation (such as in), and infection (such as in). This procedure can also be used to obtain marrow cells for transplantation.Bone marrow biopsies remove a core of bone to allow physicians to evaluate the structure of the tissue with a microscope. These reveal both the bone and any associated cells, protein deposits, or inflammatory processes. A bone marrow aspirate is primarily a liquid sample that reveals the mixed cell population of cells within the marrow. An aspirate does not show the relationship of the cells to each other or to the bone, or the cells' precise location in relation to the bone. The procedures may be performed together, with an aspirate obtained prior to a biopsy.The most frequent site for obtaining bone marrow is the pelvic bone, known as the ilium (posterior iliac crest). A portion of this bone is readily accessible in most people from the lower back and is usually marked by shallow dimples on either side of the spine. Other sites include the front of the pelvic bone near the groin and the sternum at the front of the chest. However, the sternum is sampled only for aspiration and done in individuals older than 12 years of age. This site is considered to be a last resort because the sternum is thin and there is risk of penetrating the underlying soft tissues. The tibia (shinbone) is sampled only in infants younger than 1 year of age; it is not sampled in adults because it may not yield a sufficient sample of bone marrow cells.",
"Bone Marrow Transplant (Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant)" : "Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is a treatment which involve first harvesting specific cells calledfrom the peripheral blood of the donor. These cells are harvested by a type of filtration and then preserved, usually by freezing, and finally given to the recipient after he or she has received intensive treatment. The stem cells are usually given instead of bone marrow cells. They go to the recipient's bone marrow spaces and rebuild the bone marrow after the intensive treatment is over. The treatment does not involve surgery, but is nevertheless a form of transplantation.Stem cells are small, round cells with a squat nucleus and scant surrounding cytoplasm. Although unremarkable in appearance, stem cells can perform what have been called acts of biological resurrection.Whereas other types of cells in the body have a limited lifespan and die after dividing their predetermined number of times, a stem cell can reproduce forever. The stem cell is immortal (in cellular terms). A stem cell can forgo immortality and differentiate. By doing so, it can turn into an ordinary blood cell, like a red blood cell (an erythrocyte), a white blood cell (a leukocyte), or a large cell (a megakaryocyte) that fragments into the platelets needed for blood to clot.A relatively small number of stem cells can miraculously repopulate the whole bone marrow, provide an endless supply of stem cells, reconstitute the entire repertoire of blood cells, and restore that portion of the immune system.Under normal circumstances, stem cells are rarely seen in the blood stream. To recruit enough stem cells into the blood, stem cells are lured out of the bone marrow by a special regimen of drugs and thereby coaxed into entering the peripheral blood (the blood stream).",
"Blue Light Therapy (Photodynamic Therapy)" : "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a medical treatment that utilizes a photosensitizing molecule (frequently a drug that becomes activated by light exposure) and a light source to activate the administered drug. Very thin superficialcalledand certain other types ofcells can be eliminated this way.can also be treated as well. The procedure is easily performed in a physician's office or outpatient setting. PDT is also referred to as blue light therapy.PDT essentially has three steps. First, a light-sensitizing liquid, cream, or intravenous drug (photosensitizer) is applied or administered. Occasionally, a photosensitizing molecule that is already part of the body can be activated. Second, there is an incubation period of minutes to days. Finally, the target tissue is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light that then activates the photosensitizing medication. The mechanism by which tissue is destroyed seems to depend on the presence of activated oxygen molecules.Steps:Although first used in the early 1900s, PDT in the modern sense is a new, evolving science. Current PDT involves a variety of incubation times for different the light-sensitizing drugs and a variety of light sources depending on the target tissue. The basic premise of PDT is selective tissue destruction.At present, the primary limitation of available PDT technology for skin is the depth of penetration of the light and ability to target cells within 1/3 of an inch (approximately 1 cm) of the light source. Therefore, tumors or atypical growths must be close to the surface of the skin for PDT to work.PDT is currently used in a number of medical fields, including(), dermatology (skin),, ophthalmology, and oral medicine.In oncology, PDT is FDA approved for,, andchanges of. Its use is also being further investigated throughin general oncology for conditions including cancers of the cervix (mouth of uterus),, brain, and peritoneal cavity (the abdominal space that contains the stomach,, and internal organs).In dermatology, PDT with the photosensitizer Levulan Kerastick (20% delta-aminolevulinic acid HCl) is used for the treatment of very early, thin skin cancers called actinic keratoses (AK). The initial approval was specifically for the treatment ofof the face andwith application of the photosensitizer followed by a timed exposure to a special blue light source.

"Brachytherapy" : "Placingin arteries duringis very effective at keeping heart blood vessels open. But, even when stents are implanted, arteries narrow again in 15%-25% of people. This re-narrowing is called in-restenosis. Most restenosis is due tothat forms in response to the injury created when the stent was implanted. Some scar tissue is useful; it covers the metal stent and helps preventfrom forming. But, in some people, the process does not stop, and the scar tissue re-closes the artery. When restenosis occurs, doctors can fix the problem by radiating the site of re-narrowing. This is called brachytherapy.First  angioplasty  is performed, and a ribbon of radioactive isotopes is placed through the catheter to the site of blockage. The ribbon stays in place for about 4 to 15 minutes, and the catheter is removed.Yes. In some cases, blood clots (thrombosis) may occur at the site ofmonths after the procedure is performed.  Antiplatelet medications  are given after the procedure to decrease the risk of lateformation.Because brachytherapy is a new treatment, the long-term effects are still unknown. Studies are still underway to evaluate its effects. Two forms of brachytherapy - gamma radiation and beta radiation - were approved by the FDA in 2002.Brachytherapy is not appropriate for everyone. Those who seem to benefit most from this type of therapy for in-stent restenosis include people at higher risk for re-stenosis, for example, those withor long stenotic areas (long areas of narrowing).Sinceformation is a side effect of brachytherapy for restenosis, people who have had recent heart attacks, poor heart function and blood clots may not be eligible for this treatment.If you are at high risk for in-stent restenosis, with careful monitoring, brachytherapy may be a treatment option for you. It is best to discuss this with your doctor and an interventional cardiologist with experience into see if brachytherapy is right for you.",
"Breast Augmentation" : "Augmentation of the breast consists of insertion of a silicone bag (prosthesis) under the breast (submammary) or under the breast and chest muscle (subpectoral) and then filling the bag with saline (salt water). This prosthesis expands the breast area to give a fuller breast (increased cup size), give a better contour, and give more cleavage.The incision (cut) may be placed at various locations such as: under the breast at the breast fold; periareolar which is at the edge of the(brown area consisting ofand surrounding area); within the areola; in the armpit (axillary); or in the umbilical area.The thinnest scar is usually in the areola. The umbilical incision approach is used with an endoscope (tube with a light for visualization and placement of the breast implant).The smooth surface implant requires a large pocket and is associated with a 10% incidence of capsule contracture (tightening of the scar around the implant causing firmness or hardness). The smooth implant has only an occasional occurrence of rippling or wrinkling which gives the overlying skin a wavy appearance.A textured (roughened surface) implant is associated with a 3% incidence of capsule contracture but has a 7-9% occurrence of rippling.What are the choices of implant positions? The easiest surgical placement of the implant is under the breast tissue (submammary).A slightly more difficult surgical placement is under the chest muscle (submuscular or subpectoral) but this position is associated with a lower incidence of capsule contracture and slightly less occurrence of rippling. There is morepostoperatively than with a submammary placement.",

"Botox to Treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS)" : "Botox is one specific brand of purified botulinum toxin, which is the toxin produced by the bacterium. Medical uses of botulinum toxin began in 1980, when targeted weakening of eye muscles was identified as a potential treatment of, a condition in which the eyes don't line up correctly.Although many different types of botulinum toxin have been identified, only types A and B are approved for the use in treatment of muscle problems. In addition to Botox, other approved forms of botulinum toxin A include Dysport and Xeomin. Myobloc is the approved form of botulinum toxin B.When used for clinical purposes, the toxin is used in small amounts, leading to weakness in the muscles into which it is injected. This weakness can be beneficial in various conditions characterized by too much muscle activity, such asor spasticity. This is in distinct contrast to the disease, which occurs when the non-purified bacterium is ingested and the toxin is dispersed through the body causing widespread weakness.() is a disease that causesof the brain and spinal cord. When this occurs, axons (the parts of the nerve cells that conduct impulses to other cells) don't work well. As more areas are affected by this loss of myelin, patients develop symptoms. The specific symptom that someone might experience is related to the area of injury in the brain or spinal cord. Patients might describe numbness, tingling, or weakness. The weakness may be mild or severe enough to cause paralysis of one side of the body. In some cases, patients may developor even an inability to empty their bladder. Asprogresses, some patients are left with muscle spasticity or an involuntary painful contraction of certain muscles.",
"Breast Reconstruction" : "Breast reconstruction is a surgical procedure used to restore a woman's breast to a normal shape and size after(entire breast removed) or after(part of the breast is removed). This can be achieved by either using the patient's own tissue or using implants (prosthetics). If theand(darker area around the nipple) are also removed during the mastectomy, then both can be reconstructed following completion of breast mound reconstruction.Although breast reconstruction is considered to be an integral part of the healing and recovery process, it is not appropriate for everyone. Reconstructive efforts should not interfere or complicate the treatment of. The primary goal of the initial surgery is to treatand at the same time plan for a reconstruction if the patient is a good candidate.First and foremost, everyone should be aware of the of the Women's Health andRights Act of 1998 which mandates insurance carriers to cover the cost of restorative procedures following mastectomy. Restoration aftertreatment does not necessarily include surgery. For some women it may be as simple as just wearing an external prosthesis or a form-fitted bra. Reconstructive surgery is another option for restoring one's femininity and womanhood, but it is clearly more involved.The decision to have breast reconstruction is one that is highly personal and one that should be made by the patient without any outside influence from others. Sometimes reconstruction becomes secondary as one is learning how to cope with the diagnosis and treatment. Reconstruction is considered if the patient does not have any medical conditions that would significantly complicate the healing process (such as,,,, and history of chest wall). Although breast reconstruction can improve a woman's self-image following a mastectomy or lumpectomy, it is likely that there will be some emotional adjustments in order to accept the results of breast reconstruction. Although breast reconstruction procedures can result in a natural looking breast, a candidate should be prepared to accept that a reconstructed breast may never look like or have the sensation of their natural breast.When considering restorative options, a woman's first decision is whether or not she is interested in a reconstructive procedure. If so, then one has to consider the next question of whether reconstruction should be done at the time of the mastectomy or be delayed until thetreatment is completed. At times, even if a patient desires to have immediate (at time of mastectomy) reconstruction, their surgical team may recommend that a delayed procedure, which may carry less of a risk and less interference with the cancer treatment.",

"Breast Reconstruction Without Implants" : "Women who have hadand ahave a number of options in. If the woman does not want implants, she may choose to have her breast reconstructed using her own body tissue through what is commonly known as a flap procedure. This operation involves moving healthy tissue from one area of the body to the chest using one of two methods, tunneling or free-flap.While tissue from the back or buttocks may be used, the most common flap procedure uses muscle and skin taken from the abdomen. Using either the tunneling or free-flap technique, muscle, skin and fat are transplanted from the abdomen to the chest area. After the flap of tissue has been transferred, the surgeon shapes it into the contour of a breast.When the abdominal flap is not an option, the surgeon may use tissue from the back -- and, less often, the buttocks -- in making the new breast.Using one's own tissue and muscle results in a more natural looking breast that is not vulnerable to the problems that sometimes occur with implants. The shape, feel and contour of a breast reconstructed from a woman's own tissue more closely resemble the characteristics of a natural breast.Transferring tissue from the abdomen also results in tightening of the stomach resembling a.Flap surgery is more involved than implant surgery. And, like all major surgical procedures, it carries the risk of complications, such as bleeding, infection or poor healing. However, these complications, should they occur, can be treated at the hospital.Flap procedures also leave additionalon the abdomen, back or buttocks and require a longer hospital stay than implant surgery; on average five to six days versus one or two days for implant recipients. Generally, the additional scars resulting from the flap procedure are well concealed.Most women return to normal activities within six weeks after surgery. It may be several weeks before you can do strenuous. After you go home, you can expect some soreness, swelling and bruising for two to three weeks. You may be asked to apply medications to the suture area or change bandages at home.

Most scars will fade over time.The shape of your reconstructed breast will gradually improve over the months following the reconstruction.You'll be asked to return for regular checkups at first. If you have a temporary expander implanted, it will be expanded with saline on average once a week until the desired size is obtained (usually within six to ten office visits).After breast reconstruction, you should continue to examine your breasts every month. You should continue to have regular screening examinations, such as an annual.Breast reconstruction has no bearing onrecurrence or surveillance, and generally does not interfere withortreatment. A recurrence can still be treated by any of the standard treatment methods, which include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. In addition, reconstruction rarely, if at all, hides or obscures a local recurrence. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",

Before surgery, this is often done under deep sedation. In emergency situations, the patient is often unconscious at the time of this procedure.The tube that is used today is usually a flexibletube. It is called an endotracheal tube because it is slipped within the trachea.The doctor often inserts the tube with the help of a laryngoscope, an instrument that permits the doctor to see the upper portion of the trachea, just below the vocal cords. During the procedure the laryngoscope is used to hold the tongue aside while inserting the tube into the trachea. It is important that the head be positioned in the appropriate manner to allow for proper visualization.

"Epilepsy Surgery, Children (Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery)" : "An epileptic seizure is a sudden and transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms that are the result of an abnormal activity of the brain. Epilepticare the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. The diagnosis of epilepsy implies that there is an abnormality in the brain and that this abnormality will result in more epileptic seizures. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acuteto the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. In other words, epilepsy is the tendency to have repeated spontaneous seizures.There are different, which traditionally have been categorized as either generalized seizures or partial seizures. Generalized seizures are those in which the clinical manifestations indicate that the whole brain is involved from the beginning of the seizure. Partial seizures (local, focal) are those in which the epileptic event is limited to one part of the body or to a particular function of the brain, indicating that the epileptic seizure started in one limited area of the brain. Partial seizures may remain focal or may expand to the rest of the brain. When seizures expand to the rest of the brain these are referred to as secondary generalized seizures. Consciousness is always impaired in generalized seizures; however, in the case of partial seizures consciousness may be preserved , as in the so-called simple partial seizures, or it may be impaired, as is the case with the complex partial seizures.Among the generalized seizures, the(traditionally recognized as aseizure) is the most common type. In this seizure there is a succession of muscle contractions (tonic component), more obvious in the extremities but affecting almost every muscle of the body, followed by sudden relaxation (clonic component) and further followed by another tonic component. This succession of events is repeated several times.Simultaneously, there are other signs and symptoms including dilatation of the pupils, increased heart rate, and increased. Cyanosis (skin and lips turning blue-purple) is also seen due to persistent contraction of themuscle and holding of the breath. These convulsions are usually followed by a period of confusion. In most instances these seizures, as well as most of the epileptic seizures, last for a few seconds or at the most for 2-3 minutes. Occasionally the seizure event may be prolonged, lasting several minutes. By definition, when the event lasts more than 30 minutes, it is described as status epilepticus.Another type of generalized seizure is the, also called petit mal seizure, because the clinical symptoms are not as dramatic as with the generalized tonic clonic seizures. In the absence seizures, as the name implies, the patient looks absent, like not being here. With this type of seizure there is a sudden interruption of activities, and the patient becomes unresponsive. Usually these seizures, particularly when they last longer than a few seconds, are associated with other subtle clinical signs such as eye blinking or twitching in the face or upper body. There is almost no confusion after these seizures, and the patient returns to his/her activities without even acknowledging that a seizure has occurred.In the(drop attacks) there is a sudden loss of muscle activity, like a sudden paralysis. The patient will collapse like a marionette when all its strings are cut at once. If these seizures happen when the individual is, a fall will result, or if the patient is seated, he/she will experience a sudden drop of the head, usually without the motor reflexes that help people to prevent injuries. These seizures are very brief and might result in serious injuries, most often to the forehead, mouth, and/or face.Theconsist of rapid, jerky contractions of isolated muscles or group of muscles which may or may not result in body movements.Theconsist of a brief stiffening of the muscle groups, resulting most often in extension of the arms or legs or arching of the trunk. Some of these seizures might be associated with a forcedof air, due to a sudden contraction of the expiratory muscle through partially contracted vocal cords, resulting in a loud sound.With partial (focal, local) seizures, the clinical events originate in a limited area of the brain. The clinical manifestations depend upon the area of the brain that is abnormal. Many different clinical events can be seen with this type of seizure.For example, with simple partial seizures (consciousness is not impaired) if the focal area of the brain involved is the motor area, the patient might have rhythmic contractions in one arm or leg. If the areas compromised are more involved with the visual system then the patient might complain of visual illusions.Other abnormal sensations might be the result of lesions in the auditory, olfactory, or gustatory areas. Some other symptoms might include:These patients are conscious when the symptoms occur, and their description of the symptoms can be very useful in determining which area of the brain is involved in the seizure. This has important implications for the selection of the appropriate treatment, especially for the decision about the need for surgery.The complex partial seizures (sometimes called temporal lobe seizures or psychomotor seizures), in which consciousness is impaired, have a greater range of symptoms. The symptoms already described in the simple partial seizures might be present and might be followed by complex automatic behaviors such as manipulating objects, walking around the room, or answering questions, usually done in a rumbling, difficult-to-understand language.",
"Epilepsy Surgery, Multiple Subpial Transection (Multiple Subpial Transection)" : "Sometimes brainbegin in a vital area of the brain -- for example, in areas that control movement, feeling, language, or memory. When this is the case, a relatively newcalled multiple subpial transection (MST) may be an option. MST stops theimpulses by cutting nerve fibers in the outer layers of the brain (), sparing the vital functions concentrated in the deeper layers of brain tissue (white matter).Most people withcan control theirwith medication. However, about 20% of people withdo not improve with drugs. In some cases, surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures may be recommended.MST may be an option for people who do not respond to medication and whose seizures begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. In addition, there must be a reasonable chance that the person will benefit from surgery. MST may be done alone or with the removal of a section of brain tissue (resection). MST also may be used as a treatment for children with(LKS), a rare childhood brain disorder which causes seizures and affects the parts of the brain that control speech and comprehension.Candidates for MST undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation -- including seizure monitoring, electroencephalography (),(), and positron emission tomography (PET). These tests help to pinpoint the area in the brain where the seizures occur and determine if surgery is feasible.Another test to assess electrical activity in the brain is EEG-video monitoring, in which video cameras are used to record seizures as they occur, while the EEG monitors the brain's activity. In some cases, invasive monitoring -- in which electrodes are placed inside the skull over a specific area of the brain -- is also used to further identify the tissue responsible for seizures. 2005-2017.

The sedimentation rate is also called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate because it is a measure of the(erythrocytes) sedimenting in a tube over a given period of time. Sedimentation rate is often abbreviated as sed rate or ESR. Although this test measures a general state of inflammation, it is not specific to what causes the inflammation. It is elevated in inflammatory diseases, includingas well as in autoimmune diseases such as. It can also be elevated due to other conditions such as certainand Grave's disease.A blood sedimentation rate is tested to detect inflammation in the body. It can also be used to follow the progress of a disease.All specialties of medicine can order this simple blood test while evaluating symptoms in order to determine whether or not there is inflammation in the body.A sedimentation rate is performed by measuring the rate at which red blood cells (RBCs) settle in a test tube. The RBCs become sediment in the bottom of the test tube over time, leaving the blood serum visible above. The classic sedimentation rate is simply how far the top of the RBC layer has fallen (in millimeters) in one hour. The sedimentation rate will be higher in the presence of increased inflammation.The normal sedimentation rate (Westergren method) for males is 0-15 millimeters per hour, females is 0-20 millimeters per hour. The sedimentation rate may normally be slightly higher in the elderly.REFERENCE:Firestein, Gary S., et al.. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders, 2013.",

CA stands forantigen. CA 125 is often measured as a blood test.CA 125 is usually measured from a venous blood sample. It can also be measured in fluid from the chest or abdominal cavity. The tests currently in use are all based upon the use of an antibody that is directed against the CA 125 protein (monoclonal antibody technique).In 1991, an improved version of the test was introduced and is sometimes denoted as CA 125 - II. The numerical figure of the second generation test results may be higher or lower than a first generation test. The first generation test is no longer used.

This injury acts as focus of inflammation and leads to the formation of plaques in the blood vessel walls. The plaques typically contain blood cells of inflammation, cholesterol deposits, and debris from the injured cells in the blood vessel lining.

The blood vessel narrowing can hinder the blood flow and the plaque can rupture and flake off of the blood vessel wall causing blockage and leading toand.The burden of plaques in the body can be proportional to the degree of CRP elevation in persons with atherosclerosis.plaques can exist in different stages throughout the body.",
"CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft)" : "According to the American Heart Association, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries are among the most commonly performed major operations. CABG surgery is advised for selected groups of patients with significant narrowings and blockages of the heart arteries (coronary artery disease). CABG surgery creates new routes around narrowed and blocked arteries, allowing sufficient blood flow to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle.Coronary artery disease () occurs whenplaque (hardening of the arteries) builds up in the wall of the arteries that supply the heart. This plaque is primarily made of. Plaque accumulation can be accelerated by,, elevated cholesterol, and. Patients are also at higher risk for plaque development if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women), or if they have a positive family history for early heart artery disease.The atherosclerotic process causes significant narrowing in one or more. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50 to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand during. The heart muscle in the territory of these arteries becomes starved of oxygen (ischemic). Patients often experience() when the blood oxygen supply cannot keep up with demand. Up to 25% of patients experience no chest pain at all despite documented lack of adequate blood and oxygen supply. These patients have silent angina, and have the same risk ofas those with angina.When a(thrombus) forms on top of this plaque, the artery becomes completely blocked causing a heart attack.When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90 to 99%, patients often have accelerated angina or angina at rest (unstable angina).

It is a type of glycoproteinproduced by cells of the gastrointestinal tract during embryonic development. It is produced in very small amounts after birth. The level of CEA in the bloodstream is thus relatively low unless certain diseases - including certain forms of- are present.CEA is most frequently tested in blood. It can also be tested in body fluids and in biopsy tissue.The normal range for CEA in an adult non-smoker is <2.5 ng/ml and for a smoker <5.0 ng/ml.The best use of CEA is as amarker, especially for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. When the CEA level is abnormally high before surgery or other treatment, it is expected to fall to normal following successful surgery to remove all of the. A rising CEA level indicates progression or recurrence of the cancer. This must be confirmed , as the CEA test by itself is not specific enough to substantiate a recurrence of a cancer. In addition, levels >20 ng/ml before therapy may be associated with cancer which has already spread (metastatic disease).Both benign (harmless) and(cancerous) conditions can increase the CEA level. The most frequent cancer which causes an increased CEA isand rectum. Others include cancers of the pancreas, stomach, breast, lung, and medullaryand. Benign conditions which can elevate CEA include, infections,,,of the, and some benign tumors in the same organs in which an elevated CEA indicates cancer.andcan cause a temporary rise in CEA due to the death of tumor cells and release of CEA into the blood stream. Changing levels of CEA during cancer treatment must always be correlated with other clinical findings. While worrisome, changes in CEA are not diagnostic of cancer progression on their own.CEA is not an effective screening test for hidden (occult) cancer since early tumors may not cause significant blood elevations. Also, many tumors never cause an abnormal blood level, even in advanced disease. Because there is variability between results obtained between laboratories, the same laboratory should do repeat testing when monitoring a patient with cancer.Medically reviewed by Jay B.

"Caring for a Continent Ileostomy" : "The, or K-pouch, is a connection of the end of the small intestine, called the ileum, to the skin of your abdomen. It allows waste to be drained. Unlike other ileostomies, the K-pouch or Kock, has a valve made by sewing the intestine in a special way so that waste material doesn't leak out but rather a tube called a catheter is inserted when it's time to empty the pouch.As the pouch fills with intestinal contents (liquids, partly digested food, etc.), pressure builds up on the pouch and its many. If this is not relieved the pouch could perforate or tear from the excessive stretching or the valve could slip or leak.The best way to prevent problems is to drain your K-pouch as instructed by your doctor. How often to drain the pouch varies from person to person but there are some general guidelines. Right after the operation you will have what doctors call an indwelling catheter, meaning that the drainage tube will be left in the pouch to drain continuously. This will last for about three to four weeks to allow the pouch to mature. After the catheter is removed you will drain the pouch several times per day. The number of times you need to drain the pouch each day becomes less over time.Please discuss you specific needs with your doctor, surgeon, or enterostomal therapist (ET), a nurse who specializes in the care of stomas. Most likely this person will meet or has met with you before the operation and has or will be instructing you on how to take care of your stoma, ostomy, or pouch.As mentioned above, please discuss your individual case with your health care providers. The following are general guidelines for draining the K-pouch. Constant drainage is recommended for the first three to four weeks for a new pouch. If the catheter or tube accidentally falls out before that time, you can easily put it back with these simple steps.If, at any time, you think pouch drainage has stopped during the course of the day, then check by:If you still think pouch drainage has stopped, remove the catheter in case food particles or debris have blocked it.the catheter with cool tap water then reinsert it.After the first three to four weeks you can stop the continuous draining and start draining several times per day or as instructed by your doctor or health care providers. Though you usually make this change after seeing your doctor for the first time after the operation, sometimes your doctor will tell you to start doing the following earlier.Over the next several weeks, the time interval between pouch drainages will increase. At night, you may be able to stop the constant drainage and go for longer periods without waking to drain the pouch.Three months after surgery, there are usually no specific restrictions. Sound practice is to empty the pouch four to six times per day and use irrigation on two of these times. However, any time you feel full, bloated, or distended, drain the pouch. Just as you would empty your bladder before engaging in physical activity or going to bed, so should you empty the continent ileostomy.Good skin and catheter care need to be continued after you go home from the hospital. It is important to keep the skin around the catheter clean and protected, as well as make sure the catheter is open and draining.

"Cervical Cancer Test (Cervista HPV Test)" : "Of the more than 100 types of papillomaviruses (HPVs) that infect humans, more than 40 types can infect the anogenital tract (genital tract and anus) of men and women and cause(known as condylomata acuminata or venereal). A subgroup of the HPVs that infect the anogenital tract can lead tochanges in the uterine cervix and causeor other genital cancers in women. The HPV types that causealso have been linked with both anal andin men.The most common HPV types that infect the anogenital tract are HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), although other HPV types can also infect the anogenital tract. Among these, HPV-6 and HPV-11 are most commonly associated with benign lesions such asand mild dysplasia of the cervix (potentially precancerous changes in the appearance of cervical cells under a microscope) and are termed low-risk HPV types. In contrast, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the types found in the majority of cervical and anogenital cancers as well as severe dysplasia of the cervix. These belong to the so-called high-risk group of HPVs. Twelve other HPV types have also been identified as causes of cervical and other genital cancers, although these are less common that HPV-16 and -18.HPV infections are transmitted primarily by sexual intimacy, and the risk of infection increases as the number of sexual partners increase.",
"CAT Scan" : "Computerized (or computed) tomography,  and often formerly referred to as computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan, is an X-ray procedure that combines many X-ray images with the aid of a computer to generate cross-sectional views and, if needed, three-dimensional images of the internal organs and structures of the body. Computerized tomography is more commonly known by its abbreviated names, CT scan or CAT scan. A CT scan is used to define normal and abnormal structures in the body and/or assist in procedures by helping to accurately guide the placement of instruments or treatments.A large donut-shaped X-ray machine or scanner takes X-ray images at many different angles around the body. These images are processed by a computer to produce cross-sectional pictures of the body. In each of these pictures the body is seen as an X-ray slice of the body, which is recorded on a film. This recorded image is called a tomogram. Computerized axial tomography refers to the recorded tomogram sections at different levels of the body.Imagine the body as a loaf of bread and you are looking at one end of the loaf. As you remove each slice of bread, you can see the entire surface of that slice from the crust to the center. The body is seen on CT scan slices in a similar fashion from the skin to the central part of the body being examined. When these levels are further added together, a three-dimensional picture of an organ or abnormal body structure can be obtained.",

Facial implants will not make you look like someone else. However, they will enhance your current features.When you sit down with your surgeon for your pre-operative consultation, he or she will ask detailed questions about your medical history. Among the things the surgeon will need to know is if you have had either cosmetic or reconstructive facial surgery before.Additionally, he or she will want to know what you seek to change about your appearance and why you are unhappy with your features. Are there other surgeries you want or need to have done, such as a,  forehead lift , or other cosmetic procedure?If you have dental problems, you will need to let your surgeon know about these.During your pre-operative consultation, you and your surgeon will decide together whether you'll have local anesthesia with an oral sedative to help you relax or general anesthesia (which means you'll be put to).In most cases, facial implant surgery is completed on an outpatient basis in a hospital, your surgeon's office or a surgical center. Your surgeon will make this determination based on your particular case.The length of surgery will depend on which part of your face is affected, but it commonly lasts between one to two hours. 2005-2017.

"Cataract Surgery" : "A cataract is an eye disease in which the normally clear lens of the eye becomes cloudy or opaque, causing a decrease in vision. The natural lens of the eye focuses light onto the back of the eye (the) so images appear clear and without distortion. The clouding of this lens during cataract formation causes blurring and distortion of vision. Cataracts are usually a very gradual process of normalbut can occasionally develop rapidly. They commonly affect both eyes, but it is not uncommon for a cataract in one eye to advance more rapidly. Cataracts are very common, especially among the elderly.Precisely why cataracts occur is unknown. However, most cataracts appear to be caused by changes in the protein structures within the natural lens that occur over many years and cause the lens to become cloudy. Rarely, cataracts can present at birth or in early childhood as a result of hereditary enzyme defects, other, or systemic congenital infections. Severeto the eye, eye surgery, orinflammation can also cause cataracts to develop more rapidly. Other factors that may lead to development of cataracts at an earlier age include excessive ultraviolet light exposure, exposure to ionizing,,, or the use of certain medications, such as oral, topical, or inhaled steroids. Other medications that may be associated with cataracts include the long-term use of statins and phenothiazines.The total number of people who have cataracts is estimated to increase to 30 million by 2020. When people develop cataracts, they begin to have difficulty doing activities they enjoy. Some of the most common complaints include difficulty driving at night, reading, watching television or movies, and recognizing faces. These are all activities for which clear vision is essential.",
"Cervical Cancer Screening Test (Pap Smear)" : "A Pap smear (Papanicolau smear; also known as the Pap test) is a screening test for cervical cancer. The test itself involves collection of a sample of cells from a woman's cervix (the end of the uterus that extends into the vagina) during a routine pelvic exam. The cells are placed on a glass slide and stained with a substance known as Papanicolau stain. The stained cells are then examined under a microscope to look for pre-malignant (before-cancer) or malignant (cancer) changes.A Pap smear is a simple, quick, and relatively painless screening test. Its,which means its ability to avoid classifying a normal smear as abnormal (a false positive result), while very good, is not perfect. Theof a Pap smear, which means its ability to detect every single abnormality, while good, also is not perfect, and some false negative results (in which abnormalities are present but not detected by the test) will occur. Thus, a few women developdespite having regular Pap screening.In the vast majority of cases, a Pap test does identify minor cellular abnormalities before they have had a chance to become malignant, and at a point when the condition is most easily treatable. The Pap smear is not intended to detect other forms of cancer such as those of the ovary, vagina, or uterus. Cancer of these organs may be discovered during the course of the gynecologic (pelvic) exam, which usually is done at the same time as the Pap smear.",
"Chemical Peel" : "A chemical peel involves the application of toxic chemical solutions to the skin in a controlled manner, producing controlled tissue death. The desired depth of the wound is dependent upon the condition to be treated. After the peel, the skin regenerates.

"Chemo Infusion and Chemoembolization of Liver" : "Arterialinfusion of theand chemoembolization of the liver (transarterial chemoembolization or TACE) are similar procedures that are used for the treatment of cancers in the liver. In both procedures, chemotherapy is injected into the hepatic (liver) artery that supplies the liver. The difference between the two procedures is that in chemoembolization, additional material is injected to block (embolize) the small branches of the hepatic artery.The normal liver gets its blood supply from two sources: the portal vein (about 70%) and the hepatic artery (30%). Primary, also known asgets its blood exclusively from the hepatic artery. These techniques can also be used to treat secondary, or metastatic liver, which isthat spread to the liver from other primary sites. These metastases also draw their blood supply from the hepatic arteries. This discussion will focus on primary liver cancer. Making use of this pattern of blood supply, investigators have delivered chemotherapy agents selectively through the hepatic artery directly to the HCC tumor. The theoretical advantage is that higher concentrations of the agents can be delivered to the cancer. The technique takes advantage of the concept of extraction: toxicity can be reduced by relying on the liver to extract or break down some of the chemotherapy after the tumor has been exposed to it before the chemotherapy gets through the liver into the systemic circulation.In reality, however, depending on the chemotherapeutic agent used, much of the drug does end up in the rest of the body. Therefore, selective intra-arterial chemotherapy can cause the usual systemic (body-wide) side effects. In addition, this treatment can result in some regional side effects, such as inflammation of the gallbladder(), intestinal and stomach ulcers, and inflammation of the pancreas(). HCC patients with advancedmay develop liver failure after this treatment. So, what is the benefit of intra-arterial chemotherapy? The bottom line is that there is a greater likelihood of having a therapeutic effect on the cancer. Nevertheless, fewer than 50% of HCC patients will experience a reduction in tumor size.",

Each of these rugs is forf mtrapy.Chemotherapy includes many different drugs, given alone or incombination. There are many drugs used to treat. Ask your doctor for specific information and side effects you can expect from your chemotherapy medications.Chemotherapy drugs are given intravenously (directly into a vein) or orally (by mouth). Once the drugs enter the bloodstream, they travel to almost all parts of the body in order to reachcells that may have spread beyond the breast -- therefore chemotherapy is considered a whole-body, or systemic, form oftreatment.Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment followed by a recovery period. The entire chemotherapy treatment generally lasts three to six months, depending on the type of drugs given. For example, a drug may be given alone or in combination with other drugs on the first day of a 21-day treatment cycle. Such cycles may then be repeated at 3-week intervals for a total of 4 cycles of chemotherapy treatment given over 3 months.Whenis found only limited to the breast or, chemotherapy may be still be given after aor. If the analysis of the findings from such a surgery suggests that there is a risk that cancer cells may have escaped from the breast and may be as yet undetectable elsewhere in the body, then chemotherapy may be recommended. This is known as adjuvant treatment and may help reduce the chance of breast cancer.Chemotherapy is sometimes given before surgery (called neoadjuvant treatment) in order to shrink theso it can be removed more easily or so that a lumpectomy can be performed instead of a mastectomy.Chemotherapy may also be given as the main treatment for women whose cancer has spread to other parts of the body outside of the breast and lymph nodes. This spread is known as metastatic breast cancer and occurs in a small number of women at the time of diagnosis, or when the cancer recurs some time after initial treatment for localized (non-metastatic) breast cancer. 2005-2017.

"Chest X-ray" : "A chest X-ray is a radiology test that involves exposing the chest briefly toto produce an image of the chest and the internal organs of the chest. An X-ray film is positioned against the body opposite the camera, which sends out a very small dose of a radiation beam. As the radiation penetrates the body, it is absorbed in varying amounts by different body tissues depending on the tissue's composition of air, water, blood, bone, or muscle. Bones, for example, absorb much of the X-ray radiation while lung tissue (which is filled with mostly air) absorbs very little, allowing most of the X-ray beam to pass through the lung.Due to the differences in their composition (and, therefore, varying degrees of penetration of the X-ray beam), the lungs, heart, aorta, and bones of the chest each can be distinctly visualized on the chest X-ray. The X-ray film records these differences to produce an image of body tissue structures and these are shadows seen on the X-ray. The white shadows on chest X-ray represent more dense or solid tissues, such as bone or heart, and the darker shadows on the chest X-ray represent air filled tissues, such as lungs.",

The test also may be used to demonstrate thathas been eliminated by treatment with antibiotics.The urea breath test is based on the ability ofto break down urea, a chemical made up of nitrogen and carbon, into carbon dioxide which then is absorbed from the stomach and eliminated in the breath. (Urea normally is produced by the body from excess or waste nitrogen-containing chemicals and then eliminated in the urine.)For the test, patients swallow a capsule containing urea made from an isotope of carbon. (Isotopes of carbon occur in minuscule amounts in nature, and can be measured with special testing machines.) Ifis present in the stomach, the urea is broken up and turned into carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is absorbed across the lining of the stomach and into the blood. It then travels in the blood to thewhere it is excreted in the breath. Samples of exhaled breath are collected, and the isotopic carbon in the exhaled carbon dioxide is measured.If the isotope is detected in the breath, it means thatis present in the stomach. If the isotope is not found,is not present. When theis effectively treated (eradicated) by antibiotics, the test changes from positive (isotope present) to negative (isotope absent).There are no risks or complications of the urea breath test.

If we could, we would protect them from any illness, no matter howthe sniffles.Now suppose you could make your child safe from some of the most deadly diseases in history...And suppose that at the same time you could also help protect your neighbors' children and other children around the country from the same diseases, and finally, you could actually help to rid the world of some of these diseases that have been crippling and killing children for centuries.You can do all of these things with one of the easiest and yet most powerful health tools ever developed. You can make sure you immunize your children.When you receive a vaccine, it helps your body to create antibodies. Antibodies are the body's defenses that fight off any foreign substances (germs). Although your body can create antibodies on its own, many of the vaccine-preventable diseases cause severe illness and even death before enough antibodies are produced.Vaccines work best when they are given at certain ages. For example,vaccine is not usually given until a child is at least 1 year old. If it is given earlier than that, it may not work as well. On the other hand, the DTaP vaccine should be given over a period of time in a series of properly spaced doses. More information about the specific diseases your child is vaccinated against is listed later in this article.Following is a description of the routine childhood immunization schedule.

"Bronchoscopy" : "Bronchoscopy is a procedure during in which an examiner uses a viewing tube to evaluate a patient's lung and airways including the voice box and vocal cord, trachea, and many branches of. Bronchoscopy is usually performed by a pulmonologist or a thoracic surgeon. Although a bronchoscope does not allow for direct viewing and inspection of the lung tissue itself, samples of the lung tissue can be biopsied through the bronchoscope for examination in the laboratory.There are two types of bronchoscopes - a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and a rigid bronchoscope. Since the 1960s, the fiberoptic bronchoscope has progressively supplanted the rigid bronchoscope because of overall ease of use.  In some patients, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be performed without anesthesia, but in most cases, conscious sedation twilight) is utilized. However, rigid bronchoscopy requires general anesthesia and the services of an anesthesiologist.  During the bronchoscopy, the examiner can see the tissues of the airways either directly by looking through the instrument or by viewing on a TV monitor.Depending on the indication the examiner will choose between the flexible fiber optic bronchoscope and the rigid bronchoscope. For example, if a patient wereup large amounts of blood, a rigid bronchoscope is used since it has a large suction channel and allows for the use of instruments that can better control bleeding.  The  vast majority of bronchoscopies are performed using the flexible fiberoptic scope because of the improved patient comfort and reduced use of anesthesia.",
"Breath Test, Hydrogen (Hydrogen Breath Test)" : "The hydrogen breath test is a test that uses the measurement of hydrogen in the breath to diagnose several conditions that cause gastrointestinal symptoms. In humans, only bacteria - specifically,bacteria in the colon - are capable of producing hydrogen. The bacteria produce hydrogen when they are exposed to unabsorbed food, particularly sugars and carbohydrates, but not proteins or. Although limited hydrogen is produced from the small amounts of unabsorbed food that normally reach the colon, large amounts of hydrogen may be produced when there is a problem with theor absorption of food in the small intestine, that allows more unabsorbed food to reach the colon.Large amounts of hydrogen also may be produced when the colon bacteria move back into the small intestine, a condition called bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel. In this latter instance, the bacteria are exposed to unabsorbed food that has not yet had a chance to completely traverse the small intestine to be fully digested and absorbed. Some of the hydrogen produced by the bacteria, whether in the small intestine or the colon, is absorbed into the blood flowing through the wall of the small intestine and colon. The hydrogen-containing blood travels to thewhere the hydrogen is released and exhaled in the breath where it can be measured.Hydrogen breath testing is used in the diagnosis of three conditions.",

This popular procedure is used to help reverse theprocess (think deepand creases across your forehead caused by years of facial expressions and environmental effects).  But don't be fooled. Younger people are also candidates if they have inherited traits, such as lowbrow or other problems.A forehead lift can be performed using one of three common procedures: an endobrow lift performed through an endoscope, an open brow lift, or a temporal lift.

If you are interested in learning about other procedures,  you can discuss the options with your surgeon.There are two methods to lift your forehead and eyebrow areas:Here's how the endoscopic lift differs: Instead of making one continuous incision, your   surgeon will make a few shorter incisions in the scalp. He or she will insert a scope (small camera on the end of   a thin tube) into one of the incisions in order to view the tissues and muscles from a screen. At the same time,   he or she will use another device inserted in another incision to make the necessary alterations.In this procedure, small anchors are used to secure the offending tissue once it's altered appropriately.   Those anchors are tiny, but mighty. They'll keep your tissue under control for years. Because the incisions are   smaller, this procedure is less invasive. You will experience minimal scarring and shortened recovery time. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",

Many people with glaucoma have not been checked and therefore do not know that they have it. Thus, glaucoma screening efforts as well as regular eye examinations are essential to detect glaucoma at the earliest possible stages.Glaucoma is usually, but not always, associated with elevated pressure in the eye Actually, glaucoma is now considered a disease of the optic nerve, or. Generally speaking, the vision loss in glaucoma usually occurs in both eyes, and is thus termed bilateral. As in many other disease states, the vision loss may not be symmetric, that is, one eye may be worse than the other. Vision loss due to glaucoma often begins with a subtle decrease in peripheral vision. If the glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it may progress to loss ofand.Vision loss in the chronic open-angle form of glaucoma generally occurs gradually over many years, while the vision loss of acute angle closure glaucoma may occur within a matter of days if not immediately treated. Since patients withrarely notice their gradual peripheral visual field loss, they may not visit an eye doctor until advanced changes have occurred. Unfortunately, the visual field loss in glaucoma represents permanent damage to the optic nerve and is therefore irreversible. For this reason, glaucoma is often called the sneak thief of sight.",
"Cholecystectomy" : "The surgery to remove the gallbladder is called a cholecystectomy (chol-e-cys-tec-toe-mee). The gallbladder is removed through a 5 to 8 inch long incision, or cut, in your abdomen. During an open cholecystectomy, the cut is made just below your ribs on the right side and goes to just below your waist.A less invasive way to remove the gallbladder is called laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This surgery uses a laparoscope (an instrument used to see the inside of your body) to remove the gallbladder. It is performed through several small incisions rather than through one large incision, usually 4 incisions, each one inch or less in length.A laparoscope is a small, thin tube that is put into your body through a tiny cut made just below your navel. Your surgeon can then see your gallbladder on a television screen and do the surgery with tools inserted in three other smallmade in the right upper part of your abdomen. Your gallbladder is then taken out through one of the incisions.With laparoscopic cholecystectomy, you may return to work sooner, have lessafter surgery, and have a shorter hospital stay and a shorter recovery time. Surgery to remove the gallbladder with a laparoscope does not require that the muscles of your abdomen be cut, as they are in open surgery. The incision is much smaller, which makes recovery go quicker.With laparoscopic cholecystectomy, you probably will only have to stay in the hospital for a few hours or overnight. With open cholecystectomy, you would have to stay in the hospital for about five days. Because the incisions are smaller with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there isn't as muchafter this operation as after open cholecystectomy.If you have previously had surgery in the area of your gallbladder, if you tend to bleed a lot or if you have any problem that would make it hard for your doctor to see your gallbladder, an open surgery may be better for you. Sometimes, your surgeon may begin doing the procedure laparoscopically and then convert to an open procedure. Your doctor will decide which type of surgery is best for you.Complications may include bleeding, infection and injury to the duct (tube) that carries bile from your gallbladder to your duodeunum (small intestine).

Despite the many types of toothpaste that exist, there are some ingredients common to most varieties. These include:The most important ingredient to look for when choosing toothpaste is fluoride.Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral. Its use has been instrumental in the dramatic drop inand cavity occurrence that has taken place over the past 50 years. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugars and starches that remain on your teeth after eating. Fluoride helps protect your teeth from the acid that is released when this happens. It does this in two ways. First, fluoride makes your tooth enamel stronger and less likely to suffer acid damage. Second, it can reverse the early stages of acid damage by remineralizing areas that have started to decay.Using fluoride toothpaste is an important way to ensure that your teeth are reaping the benefits of this dental-friendly mineral. Don't think you can skip fluoride if you live in an area where the water is fluoridated. Studies have shown that using fluoride toothpaste helps increase theof fluoride in the teeth, even in areas with water supplies containing high levels of the mineral. 2005-2017.

But which toothbrush is best?In the late 1930s, when toothbrushes with nylon bristles were first invented, consumers choosing a toothbrush didn't have many options. Now, the story's completely different when it comes to toothbrushes. Most stores that sell oral hygiene products now have an extensive collection of different types of toothbrushes on their shelves, including manual (disposable) and powered (electric) varieties.There are certain characteristics that you should look for in whatever toothbrush you choose, regardless of whether it is manual or powered.The best toothbrush head for you should allow you easy access to all surfaces of your teeth. For most adults, a toothbrush head a half-inch wide and one-inch tall will be the easiest to use and the most effective. Though there are larger toothbrush heads available, you may find that it is difficult to maneuver them to clean certain hard-to-reach areas, such as the sides and backs of your molars. The toothbrush should have a long enough handle so you can comfortably hold it in your hand.If you go to the drug store to purchase a manual toothbrush or a replacement head for your electric toothbrush, you will be able to select a toothbrush with soft, medium, or hard nylon bristles. For the vast majority of people, a soft-bristled toothbrush will be the most comfortable and safest choice. Depending on how vigorously you brush your teeth and the strength of your teeth, medium- and hard-bristled brushes could actually damage your protective tooth enamel. For even more tooth protection when you brush, be sure the bristles on the toothbrush you select have rounded tips.To ensure your toothbrush has undergone rigorous quality control tests for cleaning effectiveness and safety, ask your dentist for a recommendation. Or look for manual or powered toothbrushes that have earned the American Dental Association Seal of Approval.For disposable toothbrushes, this seal ensures that: the bristles will have safe tips; the bristles will not fall out of the toothbrush under typical brushing conditions; the handle will withstand normal use; and the toothbrush will effectively reduce plaque build-up and gum disease in its early stages.In addition to satisfying these conditions, powered or electric toothbrushes bearing the seal also must undergo safety testing in an independent laboratory and prove through a clinical trial that the toothbrush is safe for use on the tissues of the mouth and teeth as well as any dental hardware that may be in place. 2005-2017.

"Circumcision The Medical Pros and Cons" : "The issue of circumcision is as controversial as it ever has been. There are well-known religious, social, and medical reasons to recommend circumcision; however, most major medical societies have taken an impartial view of the procedure, neither recommending nor renouncing the practice.In 1975, the American Academy of(AAP) stated in no uncertain terms that there is no absolute medical indication for routine circumcision of the newborn. In 1983, the AAP and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) restated this position. In 1999, in 2005, and again in 2012, the AAP again restated this position of equivocation.Currently, the practice of newborn circumcision is very common. It has been estimated that a majority of males in the United States are circumcised. This number varies depending upon ethnicity and religious affiliation.Regarding newborn circumcision, most physicians today agree with the practice of informing parents of the risks and benefits of the procedure in an unbiased manner. Recently, however, several large studies revealed a large decrease intransmission in circumcised males compared to uncircumcised males. This finding did not impact the equivocal stance taken by these physician organizations, and they still recommend giving parents the ability to choose whether or not to circumcise their infant based on preference and religious beliefs.The penis is a cylindrical shaft with a rounded tip. The rounded tip is called the glans. There is a groove (termed the coronal sulcus) between the shaft and the glans of the penis. The fold of skin that covers the glans is the foreskin (the prepuce).A retractable foreskin is one that can be pulled back behind the groove of the coronal sulcus to expose the glans.",
"Extratemporal Cortical Resection" : "The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections, called lobes -- the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Each lobe controls a specific group of activities. With temporal lobe, which is the most common type ofinand adults, the area where thestart -- called thefocus -- is located within the temporal lobe. However,can start in any portion of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer () of the cerebrum.In, an extratemporal cortical resection is an operation to resect, or cut away, brain tissue that contains a seizure focus. Extratemporal means the tissue is located in an area of the brain other than the temporal lobe. The frontal lobe is the most common extratemporal site for seizures. In some cases, tissue may be removed from more than one area/lobe of the brain.Extratemporal cortical resection may be an option for people with epilepsy whose seizures are disabling and/or not controlled by medications, or when the side effects of the medication are severe and significantly affect the person's quality of life. In addition, it must be possible to remove the brain tissue that contains the seizure focus without causing damage to areas of the brain responsible for vital functions, such as movement, sensation, language and memory.Candidates for extratemporal cortical resection undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation including video electroencephalographic () seizure monitoring,(), and positron emission tomography (PET). Other tests include neuropsychological memory testing, WADA test (to lateralize the side of language), ictal SPECT, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These tests help to pinpoint the seizure focus and determine if surgery is possible.An extratemporal cortical resection requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. After the patient is put to(general anesthesia), the surgeon makes an incision in the, removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a window in which the surgeon inserts special instruments to remove brain tissue. Surgical microscopes are used to give the surgeon a magnified view of the area of the brain involved. The surgeon utilizes the information gathered during the pre-operative evaluation -- as well as during surgery -- to define, or map out, the route to the correct area of the brain.In some cases, a portion of the surgery is performed while the patient is awake, using medication to keep the person relaxed andfree. This is done so that the patient can help the surgeon find and avoid areas in the brain responsible for vital functions such as brain regions of language and motor control. While the patient is awake, the doctor uses special probes to stimulate various areas of the brain. At the same time, the patient may be asked to count, identify pictures, or perform other tasks. The surgeon can then identify the area of the brain associated with each task. After the brain tissue is removed, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed usingor staples. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",

"Collagen and Injectable Fillers" : "Collagen injections give your skin a plumper, smoother appearance. Although collagen is the best known filler, there are many other substances doctors can use to plump up your skin, including fat from your own body and synthetic materials. Below you will find a detailed explanation of how collagen works, followed by a list of other injectable fillers your doctor may recommend.To understand collagen, you should first understand your skin.Skin consists of three layers: the, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis). The upper-most layer, known as the epidermis, controls thefrom cells and tissue. Without this protective barrier, the body would quickly dehydrate.Just below the epidermis lies the second layer, the dermis. The dermis, although it contains blood vessels, nerves and hair follicles, is primarily made up of a protein called collagen. This protein forms a network of fibers that provides a framework for the growth of cells and blood vessels. Because it is the primary component of the dermis, collagen acts as the support structure for the skin. The hypodermis is a layer of fat and connective tissue that contains larger blood vessels and nerves. It also hosts sweat glands, fat, and collagen cells. The hypodermis is responsible for conserving your body's heat and protecting your vital inner organs.In young skin, the collagen framework is intact and the skin remains moisturized and elastic. It's resilient to the many facial expressions we adopt as well as everyday environmental exposure. But, over time, the support structure weakens and the skin loses its elasticity. The skin begins to lose its tone as the collagen support wears down. Every time you smile, frown or squint, you puton the collagen in your skin. The effect of these facial expressions is cumulative and facial lines begin to appear. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",
"Colonoscopy, Virtual (Virtual Colonoscopy)" : "is a procedure that enables an examiner (usually a gastroenterologist) to evaluate the appearance of the inside of the colon (large bowel). This is accomplished by inserting a long flexible tube (the) that is about the thickness of a finger into the anus and then advancing the colonoscope slowly into the rectum and through the colon. The tip of the colonoscope has a light and a video camera. The inner colon lining can be directly visualized in images transmitted from the camera to a television monitor. This traditional method of examination of the colon is called optical colonoscopy or, more commonly, just colonoscopy.In preparation for colonoscopy, the day before the examination the colon is emptied using laxatives. Immediately prior to colonoscopy, an intravenous infusion (IV) is started, and the patient is placed on a monitor for continuously monitoring the rhythm of the heart,, and the amount of oxygen in the blood. Medication usually is given by IV to make the patient sleepy and relaxed. If needed, the patient can receive additional doses of medication during the procedure. Colonoscopy often gives a feeling of pressure, cramping, and; however, with the aid of the medication, colonoscopy generally is well tolerated and infrequently results in significant. The type of anesthesia caused by the intravenous medications is classified as conscious sedation and is safer than general anesthesia. With conscious sedation, patients are sleepy but still arousable, and able to breathe on their own. After the colonoscopy, patients are asked not to drive for the rest of the day if medications for conscious sedation were given.Should there be polyps (benign growths that can lead to) in the colon, the polyps, almost always can be removed through the colonoscope. Removal of these polyps is an important method of preventing.",

"Colon Cancer Screening" : "The colon, also known as theor large bowel, constitutes the last part of the digestive tract. The colon is a long, muscular tube that receives still-undigested food from the small intestine. It removes water from the undigested food, stores it and then finally eliminates it from the body as stool or feces through bowel movements. The rectum is the last part of the colon adjacent to the anus through which stool passes to the outside.and rectum () is a type ofarising from the inner wall of the large intestine. Thesetumors are called cancers and can invade nearby tissue and spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumors of the colon are usually called polyps. Benign polyps do not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body like malignant tumors do. Benign polyps can be removed easily duringand are not life threatening. However, if benign polyps are not removed from the large intestine, they can become malignant over time. In fact, most of the cancers of the large intestine are believed to have evolved from benign polyps that are pre-cancerous, that is, they are benign at first but later become cancerous.will be found in at nearly 135,00 patients this year and will result in about 50,000 deaths in the U.S. It is the second most common cause ofdeath in the USA behind. It is the third most commonin both men and women.and rectum can invade and damage adjacent tissues and organs. Cancer cells also can break away and spread to other parts of the body (such as theand lung) where new tumors grow. The process wherebyspreads to distant organs is called, and the new tumors are called metastases. Direct extention to or invasion of adjacent organs is a sign of a more advanced cancer, and the chance of cure in the treatment of a cancer which has directly extended into an adjacent tissue is less, even with surgery, as hidden cancer cells may also have spread elsewhere. If a colon oris found to have spread through the lymph channels to adjacent, it is increasingly likely that even the removal of the portion of the colon and lymph nodes will not cure the patient. Findingmetastases can indicate that undetectable microscopic cancer cells may be more likely to still be present elsewhere in the body. If the cancer spreads through the blood stream to the liver,, bones, or other organs, or through lymph channels to distant lymph nodes then it is unlikely that a permanent complete cure will be able to be obtained with treatment.cancer is both preventable and curable when found early. Colorectal cancer is prevented by removing. It is cured if cancerous change is found early and is surgically removed before the cancer cells spread to other parts of the body. The National Polyp Study showed in its surveillance program that individuals who had their polyps removed experienced a 90% reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer. The few patients in the study who did develop colorectal cancer had their cancer discovered at early, surgically or endoscopically curable stages. Since most colon polyps and early cancers are silent (produce no symptoms), it is important to do screening and surveillance for colon cancer in patients without symptoms or signs of the polyps or cancers. Recommendations for cost-effective public screening and surveillance have been promulgated and endorsed by numerous societies including the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, American College of Gastroenterology, American Medical Association, American College of Physicians, etc.",

Veins carry unoxygenated blood from the peripheral tissues back to the heart. Since thein the veins is low, the blood is pumped by forward by contractions of the heart. To prevent back-flow, most veins have valves that only allow blood only to flow in the direction of the heart. When these valves become incompetent, veins become enlarged and bulging (varicose). Smaller veins that feed thesecan also become enlarged and appear as red or bluein the skin.can lead to a chronic swelling condition of the leg called venous insufficiency.

The common areas for these fat pockets include the chin, neck, hips, abdomen, thighs, buttocks and even calves and ankles.A newer technique called ultrasonic-assisted lipoplasty (UAL) may help you address that unwanted fat. UAL is an enhancement to the currently used tumescentmethod. To keep your new shape and new weight after this lipoplasty, you will need to follow a properandplan.UAL uses high-frequency sound waves to liquefy fat beneath the skin's surface before removing it with gentle suction. Tumescent liposuction and traditional liposuction cannot liquefy fat cells, and this makes the fat more difficult to remove.Early results by a select group ofsurgeons internationally have been encouraging. However, further study is needed to determine if lipoplasty will replace existing  liposuction  techniques.UAL allows physicians to remove significant amounts of fat in a single session because the fat is liquefied by sound waves. It can be especially useful in areas of dense fat such as the back. The use of sound waves prevents surrounding blood vessels and connective tissue from being damaged because fat cells are selectively destroyed and removed.Several steps are involved. Similar to traditional liposuction, the skin is marked to indicate the precise area from which the fat will be removed. Next, a large amount of very dilute anesthetic solution is injected into the body site to numb and swell the fatty area (tumescent technique).Then, in a step unique to lipoplasty, a thin tube-like instrument called an ultrasonic probe is inserted beneath the skin through a small incision. The probe is maneuvered in a crisscross pattern while sound waves generate negative pressure, causing the fat cells to implode, or collapse, and liquefy. The liquefied fat and anesthetic fluid are removed using gentle suction. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",

CT is very effective in looking at static areas, such as the brain, abdominal cavity, and extremities. Most early CT scanners take 1-8 pictures (slices) a minute, much slower than the rate of the heart. Just as taking a picture of a moving object with a camera results in a blurry picture, conventional CT scans of the heart are not helpful. A new generation of CT scanners which can take 64 pictures a minute is now available; with the use of a little medication to slow the heart rate to less than 64, CT images of the coronary arteries are now possible.This procedure use intravenous dye which contains iodine and CT scanning to image the coronary arteries. While the use of catheters is not necessary (thus the term noninvasive test applies to this procedure), there are still some risks involved.

Fat cells andcells are used as storage sites and release chylomicrons when the body needs the energy.Elevated triglyceride levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, the narrowing of arteries with the buildup of fatty plaques that may lead to,, and.Markedly elevated triglyceride levels may also cause fattyand pancreatitis.Elevated triglyceride levels in the blood may be caused by certain diseases and conditions including:Alcohol consumption can raise triglyceride blood levels by causing the liver to produce more fatty acids. However, there are some beneficial aspects of moderate alcohol consumption, defined as one alcoholic beverage per day (a glass of wine, a bottle of beer, or an ounce of hard liquor), that may balance this triglyceride rise. Moderate alcohol consumption may mildly increase(the good cholesterol) levels in the bloodstream and red wine, which contains antioxidants, may decrease the risk of.",
"Heart Transplant" : "The idea of replacing a bad organ with a good one has been documented in ancient mythology. The first real organ transplants were probably skin grafts that may have been done in India as early as the second century B.C. The first heart transplant in any animal is credited to Vladimer Demikhov. Working in Moscow in 1946, Demikhov switched the hearts between two. The dogs survived the surgery. The first heart transplant in human beings was done in South Africa in 1967 by Dr. Christiaan Barnard; the patient only lived 18 days. Most of the research that led to successful heart transplantation took place in the United States at Stanford University under the leadership of Dr. Norman Shumway. Once Stanford started reporting better results, other centers started doing heart transplants. However, successful transplantation of a human heart was not ready for widespread clinical application until medications were developed to prevent the recipient from rejecting the donor heart. This happened in 1983 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral). Before the advent of cyclosporine, overall results of heart transplant were not very good.Believe it or not, heart transplantation is a relatively simple operation for a cardiac surgeon. In fact, the procedure actually consists of three operations.is harvesting the heart from the donor. The donor is usually an unfortunate person who has suffered irreversible, called brain death. Very often these are patients who have had majorto the head, for example, in an automobile accident. The victim's organs, other than the brain, are working well with the help of medications and other life support that may include a respirator or other devices. A team of physicians, nurses, and technicians goes to the hospital of the donor to remove donated organs once brain death of the donor has been determined. The removed organs are transported on ice to keep them alive until they can be implanted. For the heart, this is optimally less than six hours. So, the organs are often flown by airplane or helicopter to the recipient's hospital.is removing the recipient's damaged heart. Removing the damaged heart may be very easy or very difficult, depending on whether the recipient has had previous heart surgery (as is often the case). If there has been previous surgery, cutting through themay prolong and complicate removal of the heart.is probably the easiest; the implantation of the donor heart. Today, this operation basically involves the creation of only five lines of, or anastomoses. These suture lines connect the large blood vessels entering and leaving the heart. Remarkably, if there are no complications, most patients who have had a heart transplant are home about one week after the surgery. The generosity of donors and their families makes organ transplant possible.",
"Hemorrhoidectomy, Stapled (Stapled Hemorrhoidectomy)" : "are defined as an abnormally enlarged vein, mainly due to persistent increase in venous pressure, occurringwithin or just outside the anal sphincter of the rectum. The anal canal is the last four centimeters through which stool passes as it goes from the rectum to the outside world. The anus is the opening of the anal canal to the outside world.Although most people thinkare abnormal, they are present in everyone. It is only when the hemorrhoidal cushions enlarge thatcan cause problems and be considered abnormal or a disease.Although hemorrhoids occur in everyone, they become large and cause problems in only 4% of the general population. Hemorrhoids that cause problems are found equally in men and women, and their prevalence peaks between 45 and 65 years of age.Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is surgical technique for treating hemorrhoids, and is the treatment of choice for third-degree hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids that protrude with straining and can be seen on physical exam outside the anal verge. Persistent or intermittent manual reduction is necessary). Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is a misnomer since the surgery does not remove the hemorrhoids but, rather, the abnormally lax and expanded hemorrhoidal supporting tissue that has allowed the hemorrhoids to prolapse downward.For stapled hemorrhoidectomy, a circular, hollow tube is inserted into the anal canal. Through this tube, a suture (a long thread) is placed, actually woven, circumferentially within the anal canal above the internal hemorrhoids. The ends of the suture are brought out of the anus through the hollow tube. The stapler (a disposable instrument with a circular stapling device at the end) is placed through the first hollow tube and the ends of the suture are pulled. Pulling the suture pulls the expanded hemorrhoidal supporting tissue into the jaws of the stapler. The hemorrhoidal cushions are pulled back up into their normal position within the anal canal. The stapler then is fired. When it fires, the stapleroff the circumferential ring of expanded hemorrhoidal tissue trapped within the stapler and at the same time staples together the upper and lower edges of the cut tissue.Stapled hemorrhoidectomy, although it can be used to treat second degree hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids that extend outside the anus after a bowel movement or straining, but return inside by themselves), usually is reserved for higher grades of hemorrhoids - third and fourth degree. Third degree hemorrhoids can be pushed back into the anus with a finger after a bowel movement. Fourth degree hemorrhoids are always outside. If in addition to internal hemorrhoids there are small external hemorrhoids that are causing a problem, the external hemorrhoids may become less problematic after the stapled hemorrhoidectomy. Another alternative is to do a stapled hemorrhoidectomy and a simple excision of the external hemorrhoids. If the external hemorrhoids are large, a standard surgical hemorrhoidectomy may need to be done to remove both the internal and external hemorrhoids.",

"Home Pregnancy Tests (Pregnancy Test)" : "*test facts medically edited by: Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhDAll pregnancy tests work by detecting a certain hormone in the urine or blood that is only there when a woman is pregnant. This hormone is called human chorionic gonadotropin (kohr-ee-ON-ihk goh-NAD-uh-TROH-puhn), or hCG. It is also called the pregnancy hormone.hCG is made when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus. This usually happens about six days after the egg and sperm merge. But studies show that in up to 10 percent of women, implantation does not occur until much later, after the first day of the missed period. The amount of hCG rapidly builds up in your body with each passing day you are pregnant.",

Some women choose to have a hysterectomy for other reasons, including other types of tumors.is an uncommon, but important reason for doing a hysterectomy.A laparoscope is a viewing tube through which structures within the abdomen and pelvis can be seen. A small surgical incision (cut) is made in the abdominal wall to permit the laparoscope to enter the abdomen or pelvis. Additional tubes can also be pushed through the same or other small incisions allowing the introduction of probes and other instruments. In this way, surgical procedures can be performed without the need for a large surgical incision.Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is a surgical procedure using a laparoscope to guide the removal of the uterus and/or Fallopian tubes and ovaries through the vagina (birth canal). (A different procedure, called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, is entirely performed using a laparoscope and other instruments inserted through tiny abdominal incisions, and the uterus, Fallopian tubes etc. are removed in tiny portions.)Not all hysterectomies can or should be done by LAVH. In certain situations, a laparoscopic hysterectomy (see above) may be sufficient. In other cases, an abdominal hysterectomy or a vaginal hysterectomy (without) is indicated. The surgeon determines the appropriate procedure for each individual case based upon the reason for the hysterectomy and the medical history and condition of the patient.",

"Hip Replacement (Total Hip Replacement)" : "A total hip replacement is a surgical procedure whereby the diseased cartilage and bone of the hip joint is surgically replaced with artificial materials. The normal hip joint is a ball and socket joint. The socket is a cup-shaped component of the pelvis called the acetabulum. The ball is the head of the thighbone (femur). Total hip joint replacement involves surgical removal of the diseased ball and socket and replacing them with a metal (or ceramic) ball and stem inserted into the femur bone and an artificial(or ceramic) cup socket. The metallic artificial ball and stem are referred to as the femoral prosthesis and the plastic cup socket is the acetabular prosthesis. Upon inserting the prosthesis into the central core of the femur, it is fixed with a bony cement called methylmethacrylate. Alternatively, a cementless prosthesis is used that has microscopic pores which allow bony ingrowth from the normal femur into the prosthesis stem. This cementless hip is felt to have a longer duration and is considered especially for younger patients. Total hip replacement is also referred to as total hip arthroplasty.Total hip replacements are performed most commonly because of progressively worsening of severe arthritis in the hip joint. The most common type of arthritis leading to total hip replacement is() of the hip joint. This type of arthritis is generally seen with, congenital abnormality of the hip joint, or priorto the hip joint. Other conditions leading to total hip replacement include bony fractures of the hip joint,, and death (, or) of the hip bone. Hip bone necrosis can be caused by fracture of the hip, drugs (such as chronic use of prednisone and prednisolone),, and systemic diseases (such as).The progressively intense, together with impairment of daily function including, climbing stairs, and even arising from a sitting position, eventually become reasons to consider a total hip replacement. Because replaced hip joints can fail with time, whether and when to perform total hip replacement are not easy decisions, especially in younger patients. Replacement is generally considered afterbecomes so severe that it impedes normal function despite use of anti-inflammatory and/ormedications. A total hip joint replacement is usually an elective procedure, which means that it is an option selected among other alternatives and can be scheduled on a routine basis. It is a decision that is made with an understanding of the potential risks and benefits. A thorough understanding of both the procedure and anticipated outcome is an important part of the decision-making process with the orthopedic surgeon.",
"Immunizations" : "Vaccine-preventable diseases are those diseases for which there is a shot that helps the immune system prepare for an infection. A person develops immunity after he or she has received a vaccine and responded to it. When a vaccinated person is exposed to a virus (for example,) or bacteria (for example,), his or her body is able to destroy the virus or bacteria and prevent the disease. No vaccine is perfect, and some people who receive a vaccine can still get the disease. This is why it is important for everyone to get the vaccine. This gives the community what experts call herd immunity and means that, basically, there are very few people who could serve as a reservoir for the disease. Herd immunity prevents severe outbreaks of diseases.The following table lists vaccine-preventable diseases:",
"Instructions for Sinus Surgery (Sinus Surgery)" : "Traditional sinus surgery involves the precise removal of diseased sinus tissue with improvement in the natural drainage channels by the creation of a pathway for infected material to drain from the sinus. In most situations, the surgeon will employ endoscopic techniques which allow better and more precise visualization without the need for external incisions. As a result, there is less swelling, bleeding, and discomfort, and a faster recovery from sinus surgery.Sinus surgery, unlike other types of surgery where a diseased part or organ is removed, involves the re-routing of existing sinus pathways in addition to removal of diseased tissue.One of the most common causes of failure of this procedure is poor post-operative care and follow-up. The doctor can only do so much. It is up to the patient to share in the responsibility of caring for this chronic illness. The following instructions are designed to help patients recover from sinus surgery as easily as possible and to prevent complications. It is very important that patients read these instructions or those provided by their surgeon and follow them carefully.The following information is provided to help individuals prepare for sinus surgery and to help them understand more clearly the associated beliefs, risks, and complications of sinus surgery. However, people are encouraged to ask their doctor any questions to help them better understand the procedure.The following complications of sinus surgery have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is here for patient information only - not to make patients overly concerned - but to make them aware and more knowledgeable concerning potential aspects of sinus surgery. The surgeon will review the risks and benefits of the surgery when obtaining consent for the operation, and will be able to discuss the chance of these complications with respect to an individual's potential risks of surgery at that time.",
"Insulin Pump For Diabetes Mellitus" : "The insulin pump is a device for continuous insulin delivery. An insulin pump is composed of a pump reservoir similar to that of an insulin cartridge, a battery-operated pump, and a computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered.Currently, pumps on the market are about the size of a standard communications beeper.The typical insulin pump isattached to a thin plastic tube (an infusion set) that has a soft cannula (or plasticneedle) at the end through which insulin passes. This cannula is inserted underthe skin, usually on the abdomen. The cannula is changed every two days. Thetubing can be disconnected from the pump while showering or. The pumpis used for continuous insulin delivery, 24 hours a day. The amount of insulinis programmed and is administered at a constant rate (basal rate). Often, theamount of insulin needed over the course of 24 hours varies depending on factorslike, activity level, and.The insulin pump allows the user to program many different basal rates toallow for variation in lifestyle. In addition, the user can program thepump to deliver a bolus (large dose of insulin) during meals to cover the excess demands ofcarbohydrate ingestion.Hundreds of thousands of people withworldwide are using an insulin pump. Although insulin pumps were first used by people with, people withsometime use them as well. Many children successfully use insulin pumps. Insulin pumps allow for tightcontrol and lifestyle flexibility while minimizing the effects of(hypoglycemia). Newer models of the pump have been developed that do not require a tubing, in fact - the insulin delivery device is placed directly on the skin and any adjustments needed for insulin delivery are made through a PDA like device that must be kept within a 6 foot range of the insulin delivery device, and can be worn in a pocket, kept in a purse, or on a tabletop when working.Probably the most exciting innovation in pump technology is the ability to use the pump in tandem with newer glucose sensing technology, known as an artificial pancreas, that administers insulin based on actual glucose levels as determined by the glucose sensor. The first such device was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2013. Manufactured by Medtronic, the device is approved for use in people withwho are 16 years of age or older. With the new device, insulin delivery is halted if a pre-programmed glucose level threshold is met. In a recent study conducted on 95 patients in Australia, the use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with automated insulin suspension reduced the rate of hypoglycemia in patients with.

The procedure can be used to locatewithin these bile ducts.  IVC also can be used to identify other causes of obstruction to the flow of bile, for example, narrowings (strictures) of the bile ducts and cancers that may impair the normal flow of bile.To do an IVC, an iodine-containing dye is injected intravenously into the blood.  The dye is then removed from blood by the liver which excretes it into the bile. The iodine is concentrated enough just as it is secreted into bile that it does not need to be further concentrated by the gallbladder in order to outlinethe bile ducts and any gallstones that may be within them.  The gallbladder is not always seen on an IVC since the iodine-containing bile may bypass the gallbladder entirely and empty directly into the small intestine.Occasional seriousreactions can occur to any iodine-containing dye. These reactions can usually be treated but they rarely may result in the death of the patient.Medically reviewed by Joseph Palermo, DO; American Osteopathic Board Certified Internal MedicineREFERENCE:Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographyUpToDate.com",

Once transplanted, the donor islets begin to make and release insulin, actively regulating the level ofin the blood.A successful islet cell transplant can significantly improve the quality of life for a person with.Once transplanted, the islet cells automatically monitorin the body and can regulate insulin levels by delivering the appropriate amounts needed to normalizelevels, even as the body's needs change (for example, after exercising or eating).Successful islet cell transplantation can provide the following benefits:As with any organ or tissue transplant, rejection of the donor cells is the greatest challenge in those with diabetes. The immune system serves to protect the body from invading substances that do not belong -- bacteria and, for example. Even when needed donor tissue is transplanted, the recipient's immune system recognizes it as foreign and tries to destroy it. This attack on the donor tissue is called rejection.All transplant recipients must take, for the rest of their life, strong drugs to suppress the immune response and prevent rejection. Many of these drugs have serious side effects. The long-term effects of these immunosuppressive or anti-rejection drugs are not yet known, but it is suspected that they may increase the risk of.Scientists developed the procedure for transplanting islet cells to treat diabetes in the 1960's. The first transplantation attempts, which began in the 1990's, succeeded only 8% of the time, which was attributed to the fact that anti-rejection drugs available at the time interfered with insulin's effectiveness.But in 1999, a clinical trial conducted at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, brought new hope. Using enhanced techniques to collect and prepare the extremely fragile donor islet cells, as well as using improved anti-rejection drugs, the researchers achieved a 100% success rate. All of the patients in their trial were freed from the need for insulin for at least one month. The process followed by the researchers -- dubbed the Edmonton Protocol -- is still being studied inaround the world.Typically, candidates for islet cell transplantation are between the ages of 18 and 65, have hadfor more than 5 years, and are experiencing diabetes-related complications such as frequent periods of unconsciousness due to lack of insulin and early signs of kidney problems that could lead to.Because it is still considered an experimental therapy, islet cell transplantation for diabetes is not widely available. There are currently 17 U.S. centers participating in islet cell research programs. The American Diabetes Association recommends that pancreas or islet cell transplantation be performed only in these major centers, which are best equipped to handle the complex and long-term medical and personal needs of transplant patients.There are two main areas of focus in islet cell transplantation research:Researchers are also working to develop methods of transplanting islet cells that will reduce or eliminate the risk of rejection and the need for immunosuppression. One approach involves coating the islet cells with a special gel that prevents the immune system from recognizing and targeting the donor cells.SOURCES:Reviewed byon March 08, 2009 2005-2017.

Although IUDs are highly effective, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.It is not fully understood how IUDs work. They are thought to preventby causing a brief localized inflammation that begins about 24 hours after insertion. The inflammatory reaction inside the uterus attracts white blood cells, which produce substances that are toxic or poisonous to sperm. The progesterone-releasing IUDs also cause a subtle change in the lining of the uterus that impairs the implantation of the egg in the uterine wall. This type of IUD also alters the cervical mucus, which, in turn, inhibits sperm from passing through the cervix.",

This procedure utilizes a highly specialized laser (excimer laser) designed to treat refractive errors, improve vision, and reduce or eliminate the need for glasses or. This laser procedure alters the shape of the cornea, which is the transparent front covering of the eye. Though the excimer laser had been used for many years before, the development of LASIK is generally credited to Ioannis Pallikaris from Greece around 1991.During the LASIK procedure, a specially trained eye surgeon first creates a precise, thin hinged corneal flap using a microkeratome. The surgeon then pulls back the flap to expose the underlying corneal tissue, and then the excimer laser ablates (reshapes) the cornea in a unique pre-specified pattern for each patient. The flap is then gently repositioned onto the underlying cornea without.In the human eye, the front surface (cornea) andinside the eye form the eye's focusing system and are primarily responsible for focusing incoming light rays onto the surface of the, much like the lenses of a camera focus light onto the film. In a perfect optical system, the power of the cornea and lens are perfectly matched with the length of the eye and images are in focus; any mismatch in this system is called a refractive error, and the result is a blurred image at some location.There are three types of refractive errors:Glasses or contact lenses are used to compensate for the eye's refractive error by bending light rays in a way that complements the eye's specific refractive error. In contrast, LASIK and other forms of refractive surgery are intended to correct the eye's refractive error to reduce the need for other visual aids.",

There are pros and cons to weigh in choosing betweenand photorefractive keratectomy. In terms of cost, photorefractive keratectomy is usually less expensive than LASIK. Post operative discomfort is typically less of an issue with LASIK. Ultimately, the choice comes down to which procedure will produce the most reliable outcome, and this is largely determined by factors such as corneal health and degree of refractive error.Photorefractive keratectomy can treat a variety of refractive errors including(),(), and. It can also be used to correct other irregularities of refraction in some individuals.The ideal candidate is someone whose corneal tissue is well suited for the procedure. Several criteria must be met first. For example, corneal thickness is important. Larger corrections require more tissue ablation. The surgeon will calculate if there will be sufficient residual corneal tissue for the ablation to be performed safely.Ideally the eyes should also be free of underlying diseases or conditions that might affect the cornea's stability, clarity, or ability to heal well. The eye doctor reviews the medical history and performs a complete eye examination to look for any such condition which might affect the outcome.Age is another factor. If a candidate's eyes are still growing (for example, in childhood and in the teen years) the refractive error may not have stabilized. Undergoing photorefractive keratectomy too soon may result in an undercorrection.",

After many unsuccessful attempts to use adhesive tapes that were commercially available, Dr. Kase developed Kinesio Tex Tape.The Kinesio Taping Method is felt to cause physiological effects on several body systems. The systems affected by the body are thought to include the circulatory/lymphatic, neural, muscular, and fascial systems, as well as the joints. Kinesio Taping is currently being used by therapists to change muscle tone, move lymphatic fluids, correct movement patterns, and improve posture. The Kinesio Taping Method is a unique method of applying Kinesio Tex Tape in a specific manner to create change in the aforementioned systems. Benefits of using the tape are that it is more economical over time than other modalities, it is easy to learn and apply, there are less types of tape, and it may be used over a longer period of time.The Kinesio Taping Method differs from athletic strapping tape and the traditional McConnell Taping Method. Athletic strapping tape is used mostly to limit ranges of motion and to constrict muscle movement. The effect of this method is to create aover the areas that are injured so that athletes can perform sport movements and have either prophylactic support or support to an injured part of the body. Athletic tape is typically removed after the end of an athletic event.The McConnell Taping Method is a technique that tapes body parts to affect a specific biomechanical movement. McConnell Tape uses a very rigid, highly adhesive tape that is applied for no more that 18 hours and often for shorter periods of time due to patient discomfort.The Kinesio Taping Method has been developed specifically to be used in conjunction with Kinesio Tape. The Kinesio Taping Association certifies practitioners of the Kinesio Taping Method. Kinesio Tape can be identified by the words Kinesio Tex printed on the back of the tape.",

With normal lactose tolerance, all of the lactose is broken down (digested) in the intestine by an enzyme into two smaller sugars (galactose and glucose) which then are absorbed into the body. As a result, normally no lactose reaches the colon.On the other hand, in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose, the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon.

Several blood samples are taken over a two hour period following the ingestion of the lactose to measure thelevel. If lactose tolerance is normal, the glucose level in the blood rises due to the absorption of glucose from the intestine. If there is lactose intolerance, the glucose level does not rise.Many clinicians simply make this diagnosis based on improvement of symptoms when lactose is withheld from the patient'sand affravation when it is re-introduced. Other tests used to detect lactose intolerance include the lactoseand, the latter is primarily used in infants and very young children.

Some of the chemicals produced by bacteria include lactic and other acids that turn the stool acidic.Individuals with intolerance to lactose cannot drink regular cow's milk without developing, gas, and often. They instead must drink substitutes like rice or soy milk or treat cow's milk with an enzyme that digests the lactose (Lactaid) so that the smaller sugars can be absorbed in the small intestine.During the stool acidity test, infants and very young children are given lactose to drink. With normal tolerance to lactose, all of the lactose is digested and absorbed in the small intestine. In individuals who are lactose intolerant, some or all of the lactose is not digested and absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon. Through the action of the colonic bacteria, the stool becomes acidic. The acidity of stools that are passed after ingestion of the lactose then is measured. If the stool becomes acidic, the individual is intolerant of lactose.Lactose intolerance in older children and adults can be detected by using theor the lactose.Medically reviewed by Margaret Walsh, MD; American Board of PediatricsREFERENCE:Montgomery, Robert K., PhD.

"NCV (Nerve Conduction Velocity Test)" : "A nerve conduction velocity test (NCV) is an electrical test that is used to determine the adequacy of the conduction of the nerve impulse as it courses down a nerve. This test is used to detect signs of nerve injury.In this test, the nerve is electrically stimulated, and the electrical impulse 'down stream' from the stimulus is measured. This is usually done with surface patch electrodes (they are similar to those used for an) that are placed on the skin over the nerve at various locations. One electrode stimulates the nerve with a very mild electrical impulse. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to calculate the speed of impulse transmission (nerve conduction velocity). A decreased speed of transmission indicates nerve disease or abnormal pressure on the nerve. A nerve conduction velocity test is often done at the same time as an(). An EMG is carried out in order to exclude or detect muscle conditions which may be present due to muscular or neurologic disease.Symptoms that might prompt a health care professional to order a nerve conduction velocity test test include numbness, tingling, and/or burning sensations. The nerve conduction velocity test test can be used to detect true nerve disorders (such asand mononeuritis multiplex) or conditions whereby nerves are affected by mechanical compression injury (such asand other compression neuropathies). A normal body temperature must be maintained for the nerve conduction velocity test, because low body temperatures slow the speed of nerve conduction.Medically reviewed by Joseph Carcione, DO; American board of Psychiatry and NeurologyREFERENCE:Horowitz, Steven H.

It has an advantage, therefore, over the destructive techniques (CO2 laser and cryocautery) in that an intact tissue sample for analysis can be obtained. LEEP also is popular because it is inexpensive, simple, and typically has few risks or side effects.

It is not known for certain if the lesion itself triggers the, or if the seizures result from irritation to the brain tissue surrounding the lesion. For this reason, surgery may also include the removal of a small rim of brain tissue around the lesion, called lesionectomy plus corticectomy.Lesionectomy may be an option for people whoseis linked to a defined lesion and whose seizures are not controlled by medication. In addition, it must be possible to remove the lesion and surrounding brain tissue without causing damage to areas of the brain responsible for vital functions, such as movement, sensation, language, and memory. There also must be a reasonable chance that the person will benefit from surgery.Candidates for lesionectomy undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation-including seizure monitoring, electroencephalography () and(). These tests help to pinpoint the location of the lesion and confirm that the lesion is the source of the seizures. Another test to assess electrical activity in the brain is EEG-video monitoring, in which video cameras are used to record seizures while the EEG monitors the brain's activity. In some cases, invasive monitoring -- in which electrodes are placed inside the skull over a specific area of the brain -- is also used to further identify the tissue responsible for seizures. 2005-2017.

Destination therapy is used for long-term support in some terminally ill patients whose condition makes them ineligible for heart transplantation.Like the heart, the LVAD is a pump. The LVAD is surgically implanted just below the heart. One end is attached to the-- that's the chamber of the heart that pumps blood out of theand into the body. The other end is attached to the, the body's main artery. Blood flows from the ventricles into the pump which passively fills up. When the sensors indicate it is full, the blood is ejected out of the device to the aorta.A tube passes from the device through the skin. This tube, called the driveline, connects the pump to the external controller and power source.The pump and its connections are implanted during open-heart surgery. A computer controller, a power pack, and a reserve power pack remain outside the body. Some models let a person wear these external units on a belt or harness outside.The power pack has to be recharged at night.An LVAD restores blood flow to a person whose heart has been weakened by. This helps relieve some symptoms such as being constantly tired or short of breath. And sometimes it lets the heart recover normal function by giving it a chance to rest (although this is rare). It maintains or improves other organ functions, improvesperformance, and enables participation in cardiac rehabilitation.As with any surgery, there are risks involved. Your surgeon will discuss the risks of the procedure with you.After surgery, there are other risks, including:In studies, therapy with the permanent LVAD device doubled the one-year survival rate of patients with end-stage heart failure as compared with drug treatment alone.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI Scan)" : "An MRI (or magnetic resonance imaging) scan is a radiology technique that uses magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce images of body structures. The MRI scanner is a tube surrounded by a giant circular magnet. The patient is placed on a moveable bed that is inserted into the magnet. The magnet creates a strong magnetic field that aligns the protons of hydrogen atoms, which are then exposed to a beam of radio waves. This spins the various protons of the body, and they produce a faint signal that is detected by the receiver portion of the MRI scanner. The receiver information is processed by a computer, and an image is produced.The image and resolution produced by MRI is quite detailed and can detect tiny changes of structures within the body. For some procedures, contrast agents, such as gadolinium, are used to increase the accuracy of the images.An MRI scan can be used as an extremely accurate method of disease detection throughout the body and is most often used after the other testing fails to provide sufficient information to confirm a patient's diagnosis. In the head,to the brain can be seen as bleeding or swelling. Other abnormalities often found include brain aneurysms,, tumors of the brain, as well as tumors or inflammation of the spine.Neurosurgeons use an MRI scan not only in defining brain anatomy but in evaluating the integrity of the spinal cord after trauma. It is also used when considering problems associated with the vertebrae or intervertebral discs of the spine. An MRI scan can evaluate the structure of the heart and, where it can detect aneurysms or tears. MRI scans are not the first line of imaging test for these issues or in cases of trauma.It provides valuable information on glands and organs within the abdomen, and accurate information about the structure of the joints, soft tissues, and bones of the body. Often, surgery can be deferred or more accurately directed after knowing the results of an MRI scan.",
"Mammogram" : "A mammogram is an X-ray test that produces an image of breast tissue on film. This technique, called mammography, is used to visualize normal and abnormal structures within the breasts. Mammography, therefore, can help in identifying cysts, calcifications, and tumors within the breast. It is currently the most efficient screening method to detect early. Physical examinations typically find breast cancers when they are much larger than those detected by mammography.Mammography can be used to discover a small cancer in a curable stage; however, it is not foolproof. Depending a woman's age and other factors, approximately ten to fifteen percent of breast cancers are not identified by mammography, and these cancers are often found by physical examination. It is important for a woman to perform monthly BSE and have a breast examination by her doctor in addition to the mammogram in order to most effectively screen for.The American Cancer Society recommends that a woman obtain her first baseline mammogram at the age of 40. After that, she should receive a yearly mammogram. Women who are at high risk for developing breast cancer may need to obtain mammograms earlier than these recommendations and at more frequent intervals.

"Microdermabrasion" : "Microdermabrasion is a very popular, machine-assisted skin-exfoliating treatment. Microdermabrasion has advantages of low risk and rapid recovery compared to the other more invasive resurfacing methods such as, chemical peeling, and. Since microdermabrasion produces only a very superficial depth of skin removal, it works best on improving conditions on the surface of the skin such as early photoaging (sun damage), fine lines,,, and superficial scarring, although the results are not dramatic. Although the face is the most common area for microdermabrasion, any skin area, including neck, chest, back, and hands, may be treated. Microdermabrasion is sometimes referred to as microderm, lunchtime peel, Parisian Peel, and Diamond Peel.Microdermabrasion is a painless, noninvasive, skin-rejuvenation procedure using a combination of a fine abrasive tip or crystals and vacuum suction applied to the skin. There are no needles or anesthetics required for microdermabrasion. The vacuum pressure and speed are adjusted depending on the sensitivity and tolerance of the skin. Microdermabrasion is often compared to the feeling of a cat licking your face, a rough but gentle texture. Typical microdermabrasion sessions can last anywhere from five to 60 minutes. Minimal to no recovery time is required after microdermabrasion and most people immediately return to daily activity after a session.and nonirritating creams can usually be applied right after microdermabrasion. Studies have shown that microdermabrasion can even temporarily facilitate the absorption of some topical medications through increasing the permeability of the skin.Microdermabrasion works by removing a few of the top layers of the skin called the stratum corneum. Much like brushing your, microderm helps to gently remove plaque and skin debris. Since human skin typically regenerates at approximately 30-day intervals, skin improvement with microdermabrasion is temporary and needs to be repeated at average intervals of two to four weeks for continued improvement. Multiple treatments in combination with, sun avoidance, and other skin-care creams yield best results.Microdermabrasion should not be confused with dermabrasion which is an invasive surgical procedure performed typically by dermatologists orsurgeons under local or general anesthesia. Dermabrasion is a procedure for deeperscars. Dermabrasion requires anesthesia and would be too painful otherwise. Dermabrasion is also performed for certain types of deep scars.",

"Mohs Surgery" : "Mohs surgery, also referred to as Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), is a special technique that utilizes a both pathology and surgery to remove skin cancers in a physicians office. Mohs is a very precise, highly detailed method whereby horizontal pieces of tissue are cut from the bottom-most layer layers of the skinand immediately stained and examined under the microscope. Repeated saucer-shaped layers of tissue are removed and examined until no morecan be microscopically visualized in the sample.The procedure uses frozen sections of skin that are then stained with special dyes. The dyed frozen pieces of skin are examined under the microscope and a tumor map showing the sites of any residualcells is drawn by the Mohs surgeon. The process permits an examination of the entire tumors margins simultaneously while the patient is waiting. If morecells are seen under the microscope, tissue is removed at the site of involvement. Each skin layer that is removed is called a level. If no more cancer cells are seen at a particular level, then it is deemed clear (no more tumor) and no additional levels are removed.By removing only tissue where cancer is known to be present, the technique combines a very high cure rate with excellent preservation of normal skin. Once the cancer has been fully removed, the surgeon will determine the type of repair for the best cosmetic result. The surgeon may refer patients to another physician forclosure, may close the wound immediately, or may let the wound heal on its own.MMS is special because the entire edge and under-surface of eachlayer is microscopically examined for the presence of cancer cells. Traditional surgical pathology techniques uses vertical sections (bread loafing) and is only helpful to evaluate 1%-3% of the tumor margins, thereby increasing the chances that a small tumor cluster maybe missed and left behind. MMS enables the examination of 100% of the entire tumor's margin, thereby reducing the chance of recurrence of the.MMS surgery is significantly more labor intensive than conventional methods of treating skin cancers, and as a result, it is more expensive. This type of surgery is typically reserved only for certain situations, which include recurrent cancers that have not been cured by conventional techniques, large tumors with indistinct margins, tumors that occur in cosmetically sensitive areas like the mid-facial tissues, and scarring basal cell cancers, which are known to have a high recurrence rate.MMS is scheduled with the understanding that the patient may be spending the entire day in the office depending on the number of levels necessary to clear the tumor. Most of these procedures are performed with the patient in the waiting room awaiting the verdict from the Mohs surgeon.",

"Oximetry" : "Oximetry is a procedure for measuring theof oxygen in the blood. The test is used in the evaluation of various medical conditions that affect the function of the heart and.This is done using an oximeter, a photoelectric device specially designed for this purpose.  A reusable probe can be placed on the finger or a single use tape probe is placed on the earlobe or finger.The oximeters most commonly used today are called pulse oximeters because they respond only to pulsations, such as those in pulsating capillaries of the area tested.Oximeters are now a virtual fixture in intensive care units, pulmonary units and elsewhere in hospitals and health care facilities.A pulse oximeter works by passing a beam of red and infrared light through a pulsating capillary bed. The ratio of red to infrared blood light transmitted gives a measure of the oxygen saturation of the blood.  The oximeter works on the principle that the oxygenated blood is a brighter color of red than the deoxygenated blood, which is more blue-purple. First, the oximeter measures the sum of the intensity of both shades of red, representing the fractions of the blood with and without oxygen. The oximeter detects the pulse, and then subtracts the intensity of color detected when the pulse is absent. The remaining intensity of color represents only the oxygenated red blood. This is displayed on the electronic screen as a percentage of oxygen saturation in the blood.Yes. Oximetry can also be done on blood that is within the heart (intracardiac oximetry) or on whole blood that has been removed from the body.

"Liver Resection" : "resection is the surgical removal of a portion of the liver. This operation is usually done to remove various types of liver tumors that are located in the resected portion of the liver. The goal of liver resection is to completely remove theand the appropriate surrounding liver tissue without leaving any tumor behind.In patients with(Hepatocellular, HCC), liver resection is limited to patients with one or two small (5 cm or less) tumors confined to the liver with no invasion of the blood vessels. As a result of these strict guidelines, in practice, very few patients with HCC can undergo liver resection. The biggest concern about resection is that following the operation, the patient can develop liver failure. The liver failure can occur if the remaining portion of the liver is inadequate (for example, because of associated) to provide the necessary support for life.The goal of liver resection is to completely remove the tumor and the appropriate surrounding liver tissue without leaving any tumor behind. This option is limited to patients with one or two small (3 cm or less) tumors and excellent, ideally without associated cirrhosis. As a result of these strict guidelines, in practice, very few patients with livercan undergo liver resection. The biggest concern about resection is that following the operation, the patient can develop liver failure.When a portion of a normal liver is removed, the remaining liver can grow back (regenerate) to the original size within one to two weeks. A cirrhotic liver, however, cannot grow back. Therefore, before resection is performed for HCC, the non-tumor portion of the liver should be biopsied to determine whether there is associated cirrhosis.For HCC patients whose tumors are successfully resected, the five-year survival is about 10% to 60%, depending on the tumor size. This means that 10% to 60 % of patients who actually undergo liver resection for liver cancer are expected to live five years. Many of these patients, however, will have a recurrence of liver cancer elsewhere in the liver. Moreover, it should be noted that the survival rate of untreated patients with similar sized tumors and similar liver function is probably comparable. Some studies from Europe and Japan have shown that survival rates with alcohol injection orprocedures are comparable to the survival rates of those patients who underwent resection. But again, the reader should be cautioned that there are no head-to-head comparisons of these procedures versus resection.Medically reviewed by Martin E.

"LP (Lumbar Puncture)" : "Apuncture (LP) is the insertion of a needle into the fluid within the spinal canal to collect and examine the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebral spinal fluid). It is termed a lumbar puncture because the needle is placed in the lumbar portion of the back and used to puncture through tissues to enter the spinal canal.Other names for a lumbar puncture (an LP) include spinal tap, spinal puncture, thecal puncture, and rachiocentesis.An LP is most commonly performed to obtain a sample of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Examination of the fluid can be crucial in diagnosing diseases such as, neurologic diseases, or effects of systemic disease on the brain and spinal fluid. An LP can also be done to treat diseases, as a way of administering antibiotics,drugs, or anesthetic agents into the spinal canal. Spinal fluid is sometimes removed by LP for the purpose of decreasing spinal fluid pressure in patients with uncommon conditions (such as, normal-pressureand benign, for example).Sometimes a lumbar puncture is performed in patients with migraines to assure that no other underlying pathology exists.The patient is typically lying down on their side for the procedure. Less often, the procedure is performed while the patient is sitting up and leaning slightly forward.After local anesthesia is injected into the lumbar area of the back , a long needle is inserted in between the bones of the spine (vertebrae) into the spinal canal. (The needle is most commonly placed between the third and fourth.)Spinal fluid pressure can then be measured and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removed for testing.The CSF circulates around the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). This water bath acts as a support of buoyancy for the brain and spinal cord. The support of the CSF helps to protect the brain from injury.The normal CSF normally appears clear and contains various substances, such as protein and(glucose), and few if any cells.

"Parathyroidectomy" : "The parathyroid glands are four, small, pea-shaped glands that are located in the neck on either side of the trachea (the main) and next to thegland. In most cases there are two glands on each side of the trachea, an inferior and a superior gland. Fewer than four or more than four glands may be present, and sometimes a gland(s) may be in an unusual location. The function of the parathyroid glands is to produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), a hormone that helps regulate calcium within the body.Parathyroidectomy is the removal of one or more of the parathyroid glands, and it is used to treat.Hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much PTH.  If there is too much PTH, calcium is removed from the bones and goes into the blood, and there is increased absorption of calcium from the intestine into the blood.  This results in increased levels of calcium in the blood and an excess of calcium in the urine. In more serious cases, thewill diminish andcan form. Other non-specific symptoms of hyperparathyroidism include, muscle weakness, and. Every effort is made to medically treat or control these conditions prior to surgery. These efforts include avoiding calcium rich foods, proper hydration (intake of fluids), and medications to avoid.",

"Penile Implants" : "A penile prosthesis is another treatment option for men with(). These devices are either malleable or inflatable. The simplest type of prosthesis consists of a pair of malleable (bendable) rods surgically implanted within the erection chambers of the penis. With this type of implant the penis is always semi-rigid and merely needs to be lifted or adjusted into the erect position to initiate sex. Today, many men choose a hydraulic, inflatable prosthesis, which allows a man to have an erection whenever he chooses and is much easier to conceal. It is also more natural.A penile implant is usually used when there is a clear medical cause forand when the problem is unlikely to resolve or improve naturally or with other medical treatments. Sometimes a penile prosthesis is implanted during surgery to reconstruct the penis when scarring has caused erections to curve ().The inflatable penile prosthesis consists of two cylinders -- a reservoir and a pump -- which are placed surgically in the body. The two cylinders are inserted in the penis and connected by tubing to a separate reservoir of fluid. The reservoir is implanted under the groin muscles. A pump is also connected to the system and sits under the loose skin of the scrotal sac, between the testicles.To inflate the prosthesis, the man presses on the pump. The pump transfers fluid from the reservoir to the cylinders in the penis, inflating them. Pressing on a deflation valve at the base of the pump returns the fluid to the reservoir, deflating the penis. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",

Within a few hours of being deposited on the skin around the anus, pinworm eggs become infectious (capable of infecting another person). Pinworm eggs can survive up to three weeks on clothing, bedding, or other objects if the environment is sufficiently moist.If pinworms are suspected, transparent adhesive tape or a pinworm paddle (supplied by your healthcare provider) is applied to the anal region. The tape can pick up both eggs and occasionally the adult worms. Most clinicians suggest the test be done as soon as the person awakens and before any bowel movement or cleansing (bath, shower) as these actions tend to remove the eggs and parasites from the anal/rectal area.The pinworm eggs or a few adult worms adhere to the sticky tape or paddle and are identified by examination under an ordinary microscope by a qualified laboratory technician.In some individuals, it is possible to see the adult worms without a microscope, but the transparent eggs are small and can only be seen with a microscope.The test should be done as soon as you wake up in the morning (because bathing or having a bowel movement may remove eggs). The exam may require several samples for a positive diagnosis. Researchers suggest that repeating the test at about three different intervals yields about a 90% detection rate.",

Sometimes a full bladder is required to obtain better images, so you may be asked to drink several glasses of water before the test. There is noor discomfort associated with the test, and it can be performed in the doctor's office.Transvaginal ultrasound uses a probe that is inserted directly into the vagina. It is performed in the doctor's office similar to a pelvic examination. This type of exam is most commonly used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out suspected problems or to assess the gestational age of the embryo. In early pregnancy this examination can provide more accurate information then a transabdominal examination.As mentioned above, transvaginal ultrasound is most often used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out problems or to determine how far along you are in the pregnancy. Most pregnant women receive a transabdominal ultrasound around the 20th week of pregnancy. This exam confirms that the baby is growing normally and that the placenta is attached normally. The heartbeat of the fetus is visible, and the movement of the fetus can be observed. Majorcan be visualized by this method, as well. In most cases, it is possible to determine the sex of the baby through an ultrasound exam at 20 weeks, but this method is not 100% accurate. You can tell the examiner whether or not you wish to know the gender of your baby at the time of the examination.Ultrasound may also be performed earlier or later in the pregnancy for specific reasons that include:A 3D ultrasound provides a particularly clear image that resembles a photograph. A so-called 4D ultrasound provides this image in real time. Sometimes these ultrasound images are offered by non-medical providers in stores or other locations.

Decay that is left untreated can progress to infect the dental pulp and may cause an.If the filling is large or the recurrent decay is extensive, there may not be enough tooth structure remaining to support a replacement filling. In these cases, your dentist may need to replace the filling with a crown.New fillings that fall out are probably the result of improper cavity preparation, contamination of the preparation prior to placement of the restoration or a fracture of the restoration from bite or chewing.

 "Prostate Specific Antigen" : "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a substance produced only by certain cells within the male prostate gland. Biochemically, it belongs to the protease family of kallikrein and is also known as human kallikrein 3 (hK3). PSA is released by the prostate into the semen where it acts to liquefy the semen following ejaculation. Most of the PSA produced by the prostate gland is carried out of the body in semen, but a very small amount escapes into the bloodstream, so PSA is normally found in low amounts (nanograms per milliliter or ng/mL) in the blood. PSA has also been found in some breast tissue in women, although these amounts of PSA are very low.If the PSA level is high for your age or is steadily increasing (with or without an abnormal physical exam), further investigation, namely a prostate biopsy, may be recommended. The health care provider should consider other health risk factors of prostate cancer such as family history, prostate volume, the presence of(BPH), urinary symptoms, rectal exam findings, ethnicity, and medications that you are taking before recommending the biopsy.

 "PUVA Therapy (Photochemotherapy)" : "PUVA is an acronym. The P stands for psoralen, the U for ultra, the V for violet, and the A for that portion of the solar spectrum between 320 and 400 nanometers in wavelength. Psoralens are chemicals found in certain plants that have the ability to absorb ultraviolet light in the UVA portion of the solar spectrum. Once the light energy is absorbed, these psoralens are energized to interact with DNA, ultimately inhibiting cell multiplication, which is its presumed mode of action.Certain skin diseases are characterized by cells that are rapidly multiplying. Inhibiting this unrestrained proliferation can be useful in treating these diseases. So PUVA is a combination of an oral drug and subsequent ultraviolet light exposure.One of the skin diseases for which PUVA is used and for which it was originally developed is. The psoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) (Oxsoralen), is used for the treatment ofalong with exposures to ultraviolet light in the UVA spectrum. PUVA is also of benefit in treating, mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell), and graft versus host disease.The most common form of therapy combines 8-methoxypsoralen taken by mouth followed 45-60 minutes later by exposure of the skin to UVA.

Eventually, as many as 50% of them want to have laser tattoo removal.There is good news for those who have an unwanted body design. Newer laser tattoo removal techniques can eliminate your tattoo with minimal side effects. Here's how it works: lasers remove tattoos by breaking up the pigment colors of the tattoo with a high-intensity light beam.Black tattoo pigment absorbs all laser wavelengths, making it the easiest to treat. Other colors can only be treated by selected lasers based upon the pigment color.Because each tattoo is unique, removal techniques must be tailored to suit each individual case. In the past, tattoos could be removed by a wide variety of methods but, in many cases, thewere more unsightly than the tattoo itself.Patients with previously treated tattoos may also be candidates for laser therapy. Tattoos that have not been effectively removed by other treatments or through home remedies may respond well to laser therapy providing the prior treatments did not result in excessive scarring.To have a tattoo removed, you want to make sure you find a reputable dermatologist orcenter to ensure proper treatment and care. If possible, you should obtain a recommendation from your family doctor for a dermatologist or skin surgery center that specializes in tattoo removal.Depending on the size and color of your tattoo, the number of treatments will vary. Your tattoo may be removed in two to four visits, though many more sessions may be necessary. You should schedule a consultation, during which time a trained professional will evaluate your personal situation and advise you on the process.Treatment with the laser varies from patient to patient depending on the age, size and type of tattoo (amateur or professional). The color of the patient's skin, as well as the depth to which the tattoo pigment extends, will also affect the removal technique.In general, this is what will happen during an office visit for tattoo removal using the newer lasers:Most patients do not require any anesthesia. However, depending on the location of the tattoo and thethreshold for the patient, the physician may elect to use some form of anesthesia (topical anesthesia cream or painkiller injections at the site of the procedure). 2005-2017.

In a thyroid scan, iodine is labeled with a radioactive tracer, and a special camera is used to measure how much tracer is absorbed from the bloodstream by the thyroid gland. If a patient isto iodine, technetium can be used as an alternative.A thyroid scan is an outpatient procedure usually done in the nuclear medicine section of a hospital. This is usually part of the radiology department.If you have a thyroid scan, you will be asked to take a drink, or swallow a pill containing the iodine.

At this time you lie under a scintography camera, and it will take pictures which correlate directly to the amount of iodine taken up by the thyroid. This is done by counting the intensity and location of the gamma rays emitted by the radioactively labeled iodine. You then leave the hospital, and return in 24 hours to have a second scan performed in the same manner.There are no limitations during this 24 hour interval except that you will be asked to take precautions when you urinate. This is because the radioactive iodine is removed from your body by the urine, and it is safer to have others avoid contact with your urine during this time. Be sure to let the doctor performing the test know if you have an iodine, or if you have ingested a lot of iodine-containing foods (like sushi) prior to the test.",

Examples of other uses of radiofrequency ablation include:Radiofrequency ablation is used to treat hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) of the liver, primary cancers that arise in the liver cells, when these tumors are small and the patient is not an appropriate candidate for surgical removal of theor liver transplantation. Radiofrequency ablation also can be used on liver tumors that have originated elsewhere in the body and have spread (metastasized) to the liver.",
 "Temporal Lobe Resection" : "The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections -- the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Each lobe controls a specific group of activities. The temporal lobe, located on either side of the brain just above the ear, plays an important role in, language, and memory. In people with temporal lobe, the area where thestart -- called thefocus -- is located within the temporal lobe. This is the most common type ofinand adults.Temporal lobe resection may be an option for people withwhose seizures are disabling and/or not controlled by medication, or when the side effects of medication are severe and significantly affect the person's quality of life. In addition, it must be possible to remove the brain tissue that contains the seizure focus without causing damage to areas of the brain responsible for vital functions, such as movement, sensation, language, and memory.Candidates for temporal lobe resection undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation -- including seizure monitoring, electroencephalography (),(), and positron emission tomography (PET). These tests help to pinpoint the seizure focus within the temporal lobe and to determine if surgery is possible.A temporal lobe resection requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. (Crani refers to the skull and otomy means to cut into.) After the patient is put towith anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the, removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a window in which the surgeon inserts special instruments for removing the brain tissue. Surgical microscopes also are used to give the surgeon a magnified view of the area of the brain involved. The surgeon utilizes information gathered during the pre-operative evaluation -- as well as during surgery -- to define, or map out, the route to the correct area of the temporal lobe.In some cases, a portion of the surgery is performed while the patient is awake, using medication to keep the person relaxed and-free. This is done so that the patient can help the surgeon find and avoid areas of the brain responsible for vital functions. While the patient is awake, the doctor uses special probes to stimulate different areas of the brain. At the same time, the patient is asked to count, identify pictures, or perform other tasks. The surgeon can then determine the area of the brain associated with each task. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",

 "TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt)" : "Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or (TIPS) is a shunt (tube) placed between the portal vein which carries blood from theand intraabdominal organs to theand the hepatic vein which carries blood from the liver back to the vena cava and the heart.It is used primarily (but not exclusively) in patients within which thewithin the liver causes partial blockage of flow of blood passing through the liver from the portal vein to the hepatic vein. The blockage increases the pressure in the portal vein, which is called. As a result of the increase in pressure, portal blood flows preferentially or shunts through the branches of the portal vein to veins coming from abdominal organs that normally drain toward the portal vein. These organs connect with veins that do not empty into the portal vein and thus bypass the liver. Thus, much of the flow of blood bypasses the liver. If these veins going to the other organs enlarge, they are referred to as variceal veins or varices. Unfortunately, one of the places varices form is in the stomach and lower, and these varices have a tendency to bleed massively, frequently causing death from exsanguination. By providing an artificial path for blood traveling from the intestines, through, the liver, and back to the heart, the shunt placed during the TIPS procedure reduces the pressure in the portal vein, significantly decreasing the likelihood of varices bleeding.",
 "Tilt-table Test" : "Theis a simple, inexpensive, and informative test that can help identify the causes of. As its name implies, the tilt table test involves placing a patient on a table with a foot-support, then tilting the table upward. The tilt-table may start off in a horizontal position and be tilted by degrees to a completely vertical position. The patient's, pulse, and symptoms are monitored throughout the test.The tilt-table test is designed to detect one of the most common causes of fainting or, a phenomenon known as(). Tilt-table testing may be done whenis not suspected of being responsible for an attack of fainting () or near-syncope.Posturalis a common cause of an episode of temporaryor feelings of lightheadedness. Posturalresults from changing body position from a prone, supine, or sitting position to a more vertical position. Normally, blood tends to pool in the legs due to gravity when a person stands up, potentially reducing the amount of blood available to return to the heart. Nerves to the blood vessels in the legs normally act to compensate for this pooling by constricting, thus sending blood away from the leg veins and toward the heart. However, poor tone of the nerves to blood vessels in the legs can cause this mechanism to fail, resulting in a disproportionate distribution of blood to the legs, instead of returning to the circulation, so the brain receives less oxygen. As a result, a person feels lightheaded and may even faint.Depending on the presence or absence of signs and symptoms during the tilt-table test, persons with certain forms of temporary loss of consciousness may be admitted to the hospital for observation and further testing. The tilt-table test is also performed on stabilized patients who are in the hospital for evaluation of the cause of temporary loss of consciousness.No. It is painless. However, patients may experience symptoms such as feeling lightheaded, nauseated,, or weakness. Any symptoms recorded during the test can help the doctor to diagnose the cause of an episode of temporary loss of consciousness or lightheadedness.Medically reviewed by Avrom Simon, MD; Board Certified Preventative Medicine with Subspecialty in Occupational MedicineREFERENCE:Upright tilt table testing in the evaluation of syncopeuptodate.com",
 "Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)" : "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a technique used to treat. It involves implanting a-like device that generates pulses of electricity to stimulate the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is one of the 12 cranial nerves, the paired nerves that attach to the undersurface of the brain and relay information to and from the brain. Cranial nerve fibers conduct impulses between the brain and other parts of the brain and various body structures, mostly in the head and neck. The vagus nerve - the longest of the cranial nerves - also extends to organs in the chest and abdomen. (The word vagus comes from a Latin word for wandering.')Some cranial nerves bring information from the senses (like touch or sight) to the brain (sensory) and some control muscles (motor). Other cranial nerves, like the vagus, have both motor and sensory functions. The vagus nerve serves many organs and structures, including the larynx (voice box),, heart and gastrointestinal tract.While the patient is asleep (general anesthesia), the stimulator device - which is about the size of a silver dollar - is surgically placed under the skin in the upper part of the chest. A connecting wire is run under the skin from the stimulator to an electrode that is attached to the vagus nerve, which is accessible through a small incision (cut) in the neck.After it is implanted, the stimulator is programmed using a computer to generate pulses of electricity at regular intervals, depending on the patient's tolerance. For example, the device may be programmed to stimulate the nerve for 30 seconds every five minutes. The settings on the device are adjustable, and the electrical current is gradually increased as the patient's tolerance increases. Re-programming the stimulator can be done in the doctor's office. The patient also is given a hand-held magnet, which when brought near the stimulator, can generate an immediate current of electricity to stop ain progress or reduce the severity of the seizure.VNS is an add-on therapy, which means it is used in addition to another type of treatment. Patients who undergo VNS continue to take their seizure medications. In some cases, however, it may be possible to reduce the dosage of medication. 2005-2017. All rights reserved.",

 "Tracheostomy" : "A tracheostomy is a surgically created opening in the neck leading directly to the trachea (thetube). It is maintained open with a hollow tube called a tracheostomy tube.A tracheostomy is usually done for one of several reasons:It is important to understand that a tracheostomy, as with all surgeries, involves potential complications and possible injury from both known and unforeseen causes. Because individuals vary in their tissue circulation and healing processes, as well as anesthetic reactions, ultimately there can be no guarantee made as to the results or potential complications. Tracheostomies are usually performed during emergency situations or on very ill patients. This patient population is, therefore, at higher risk for a complication during and after the procedureThe following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is listed here for information only in order to provide a greater awareness and knowledge concerning the tracheostomy procedure.Obviously, many of the types of patients who undergo a tracheostomy are seriously ill and have multiple organ-system problems. The doctors will decide on the ideal timing for the tracheostomy based on the patient's status and underlying medical conditions.In most situations, the surgery is performed in the intensive care unit or in the operating room. In either location, the patient is continuously monitored by pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation) and cardiac rhythm (). The anesthesiologists usually use a mixture of an intravenous medication and a local anesthetic in order to make the procedure comfortable for the patient.The surgeon makes an incision low in the neck. The trachea is identified in the middle and an opening is created to allow for the new breathing passage (tracheostomy tube) to be inserted below the voice box (larynx). Newer techniques utilizing special instruments have made it possible to perform this procedure via a percutaneous approach (a less invasive approach using a piercing method rather than an open surgical incision).The surgeons will monitor the healing for several days after the tracheostomy. Usually, the initial tube that was placed at the time of surgery will be changed to a new tube sometime between 10 and 14 days following surgery, depending on the specific circumstances. Subsequent tube changes are usually managed by the treating physician orstaff.Speech will be difficult until the time comes for a special tube to be placed which may allow talking by allowing the flow of air up to the vocal cords. Any time a patient requires mechanical ventilation, air is prevented from leaking around the tube by a balloon. Therefore, while the patient is on a mechanical ventilator, he/she will be unable to talk. Once the doctors are able to decrease the-size of the tube, speaking may be possible. At the appropriate time, instructions will be given. Oral feeding may also be difficult until a smaller tube is placed.If the tracheostomy tube will be necessary for a long period of time, the patient and family will be instructed on home care. This will include suctioning of the trachea, and changing and cleaning the tube. When the time comes you will be provided with ample information, instruction, and practice. Often, home healthcare will be provided, or the patient will be transferred to an intermediate health care facility.In some cases (especially when performed during an emergency or prolonged) the tracheostomy will not be a permanent situation. If the patient can tolerate breathing without the tracheostomy tube the surgical site can be closed, leaving a scar at the outside of the neck.Medically reviewed by John A.

If these procedures do not eliminate the symptoms of(also called angina), other treatment options are available.TMR, or transmyocardial laser revascularization, is a new treatment aimed at improving blood flow to areas of the heart that were not treated by angioplasty or surgery.  A special carbon dioxide (CO) laser is used to create small channels in the heart muscle, improving blood flow to the heart muscle.TMR is a surgical procedure.  It is performed through a small incision in either the left side or the middle of the chest.  Frequently, it is performed along with coronary bypass surgery, occasionally alone.Once the incision is made, the surgeon exposes the heart muscle.  A laser hand piece is then positioned on the area of the heart to be treated.  A special high-energy, computerized COlaser is used to create between 20 to 40 one-millimeter-wide channels (about the width of the head of a pin) in the(left lower pumping chamber) of the heart.  The doctor determines how many channels to create during the procedure.  The outer areas of the channels close, but the inside of the channels remain open inside the heart to improve blood flow.The COHeart Laser uses a computer to direct laser beams to the appropriate area of the heart in between heartbeats, when the ventricle is filled with blood and the heart is relatively still.  This helps to prevent electrical disturbances (arrhythmias) in the heart.Doctors aren't sure how TMR improves blood flow to the heart.  Clinical evidence suggests blood flow is improved in two ways:TMR usually takes one to two hours.  The procedure may last longer if it is combined with other heart procedures.TMR is a treatment option for individuals who:TMR has shown positive clinical benefits for patients who may require one or two bypass grafts, yet also have other areas of the heart that are not able to be bypassed with direct bypass-surgery.

In addition, visual field tests are useful for detection of central or peripheral retinal diseases of the retina,conditions such as drooping (ptosis), optic nerve damage and disease, and conditions affecting the visual pathways from the optic nerve to the area of the brain (occipital cortex) where this information is processed into vision.The following are uses of visual field testing:",
 "Urodynamic Testing" : "The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. Blood flows through the kidneys, and the kidneys filter out wastes and extra water, making urine. The urine travels down two narrow tubes called the ureters. The urine is then stored in a muscular, balloonlike organ called the bladder. The bladder swells into a round shape when it is full and gets smaller as it empties. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through the urethra.The lower urinary tract includes the bladder and urethra. The bladder sits in the pelvis and is attached to other organs, muscles, and the pelvic bones, which hold it in place. The urethra is a tube at the bottom of the bladder that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.The lower urinary tract works by coordinating the muscles of the bladder wall with the sphincters, which are circular muscles that surround the area of the bladder that opens into the urethra. The muscles of the bladder wall relax as the bladder fills with urine. If the urinary tract is healthy, the bladder can hold up to 2 cups, or 16 ounces, of urine comfortably for 2 to 5 hours. The sphincters close tightly like rubber bands around the bladder to help keep urine from leaking. As the bladder fills, the need to urinate becomes stronger and stronger, until the bladder reaches its limit. Urination is the process of emptying the bladder. To urinate, the brain signals the bladder muscles to tighten, squeezing urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincters to relax. As the sphincters relax, urine exits the bladder through the urethra. When all the signals occur in the correct order, normal urination occurs.Urodynamic testing is any procedure that looks at how well the bladder, sphincters, and urethra are storing and releasing urine. Most urodynamic tests focus on the bladder's ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely. Urodynamic tests can also show whether the bladder is having involuntary contractions that cause urine leakage. A health care provider may recommend urodynamic tests if symptoms suggest problems with the lower urinary tract. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) includeUrodynamic tests range from simple observation to precise measurements using sophisticated instruments. For simple observation, a health care provider may record the length of time it takes a person to produce a urinary stream, note the volume of urine produced, and record the ability or inability to stop the urine flow in midstream. For precise measurements, imaging equipment takes pictures of the bladder filling and emptying, pressure monitors record the pressures inside the bladder, and sensors record muscle and nerve activity. The health care provider will decide the type of urodynamic test based on the person's health information, physical exam, and LUTS. The urodynamic test results help diagnose the cause and nature of a lower urinary tract problem.Most urodynamic tests do not involve special preparations, though some tests may require a person to make a change in fluid intake or to stop taking certain medications. Depending on the test, a person may be instructed to arrive for testing with a full bladder.",

 "Stitches" : "The ability to close a skin wound is an important skill learned by medical care providers. Whether the skin injury was made by a scalpel in the operating room or by a fall in the street, the decision as to how and when to repair the damage needs to be individualized for each patient and situation.The skin has many layers from theon the outside, to the deeper subcutaneous tissues and the dermis in between. Each of these layers has other sub-layers that help the skin perform its functions. The skin provides a barrier to the outside world and the dangers of infection, environmental hazards and chemicals, and temperature. It contains melanocytes that can darken or tan the skin while protecting the body from ultraviolet radiation. It also plays an important role in temperature and fluid regulation.Different options exist for repairing lacerated skin and providing a nice cosmetic outcome. However, there are two important steps that need to occur before the skin is closed.The purpose ofis not simply to yield a good-looking scar. All wounds will eventually heal over time, although closing the skin edges will make that healing time shorter. The primary purpose of seeking medical care from a health-care professional is to get the wound properly cleaned and make certain everything is in good working order beneath the damaged skin.When a laceration occurs, there are some reasonableand home-care steps to consider. Washing with tap water to clean the wound is always helpful. Studies have shown that plain tap water is as good as any special fluids that are used in hospitals for cleaning wounds. The wound should be lightly bandaged and elevated if possible.The amount of blood supplied to different parts of the body varies. A wound on the face,, or hand may bleed profusely while one on the shin or back may not. Bleeding will often stop with direct pressure at the bleeding site and elevation of the injured part of the body.",
 "Snoring Surgery (Somnoplasty)" : "During normal, air passes through the throat on its way to the. The air travels past the tongue, soft palate, uvula, and. The soft palate is the back of the roof of the mouth. The uvula is the prominent anatomic structure dangling downward visibly at the back of the mouth (pharynx). When a person is awake, the muscles in the back of the throat tighten to hold these structures in place preventing them from collapsing and/or vibrating in the. During, the uvula and soft palate frequently vibrate causing the distinctive sounds of snoring. Snoring may also originate from the walls of the throat and further down around the tongue base.The most important aspect of snoring treatment is to first rule out the presence of obstructiveapnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is well known to be associated with signficiant medical problems such as, risk for, increased somnolence, and increased risk for motor vehicle accidents. Snoring is a hallmark sign of obstrucrive sleep apnea for many patients. However, just because someone snores, it does not mean they have sleep apnea. To rule out obstructive sleep apnea, they require an overnight sleep study. The test is usually conducted in a lab or at home with specialized equipment and should be evaluated by a sleep medicine physician. When snoring is present without obstructive sleep apnea, it is called primary snoring.Somnoplasty is an unique surgical method for reducing habitual snoring by removing or stiffening tissues of the uvula and soft palate. Unlike other approaches (such as the laser), somnoplasty uses very low levels of radiofrequency heat energy to create finely controlled localized burn-areas beneath the lining (mucosa) of the soft tissues of the soft palate. These burn areas are eventually resorbed by the body, shrinking the tissue volume and stiffening the tissues, thereby reducing symptoms of snoring. Somnoplasty is performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting and takes approximately 30 minutes.The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is here for your information only, not to frighten you, but to make you aware and more knowledgeable concerning this procedure. Although many of these complications are rare, all have occurred, at one time or another, in the hands of experienced surgeons practicing the standards of community care. Anyone who is contemplating any type of surgery must weigh the potential risks and complications against the potential benefits of the surgery, or any alternative to surgery."}
