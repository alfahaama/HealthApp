"Cyanosis/Turning Blue" : " Cyanosis is the medical term for a bluish color of the skin and the mucous membranes due to an insufficient level of oxygen in the blood. For example, the lips and fingernails may show cyanosis. Cyanosis can be evident at birth due to the presence of a heart malformation that permits blood that is not fully oxygenated to enter the arterial circulation. Cyanosis can also appear at any time later in life and often accompanies conditions in which lung function is compromised (resulting in an inability to fully oxygenate the blood) or conditions in which the heart's pumping function is compromised. The presence of abnormal forms ofor other abnormalities of the blood cells can also sometimes cause cyanosis. The medical term for lowered oxygen levels is; the term anoxia refers to the absence of oxygen.Pseudocyanosis is the appearance of cyanosis that is not associated with reduced oxygen delivery to tissues.

"Gas" : " Gas or  means different things to different people.  Everyone has gas and eliminates it by belching or passing it through the rectum, medically referred to as flatulence (slang, farting).The ability to belch is almost universal. Belching, also known as burping, is the act of expelling gas from the stomach out through the mouth. The usual cause of belching is a distended (inflated) stomach caused by swallowed air. The distention of the stomach causes abdominal discomfort, and the belching expels the air and relieves the discomfort. The common reasons for swallowing large amounts of air (aerophagia) are gulping food or drink too rapidly,, and carbonated beverages.Excessive air in the stomach is not the only cause of belching. For some people, belching becomes a habit and does not reflect the amount of air in their stomachs. For others, belching is a response to any type of abdominal discomfort and not just to discomfort due to increased gas.Most people produce 1 to 3 pints of intestinal gas in their large intestines (colons) every 24 hours and pass gas an average of 14 times a day. The gas is made up primarily of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and in some families, methane, that is mixed with nitrogen and oxygen from room air that is inhaled or swallowed. The carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane are produced by bacteria in the large intestine while they digest undigested food that reaches the large intestine. Although these gases are odorless, the bacteria also may produce small amounts of sulfur-containing gases that are foul-smelling.  It is important to distinguish between increased flatulence (farting) and foul-smelling flatulence.Bloating is the subjective sensation (feeling) that the abdomen is larger than normal. Thus, bloating is a symptom akin to the symptom of discomfort. In contrast, distention is the objective determination (physical finding) that the abdomen is actually larger than normal. Bloating and distention may be due to increased amounts of gas in the abdomen, but there also are other causes. Sometimes intestinal gas that is associated with bloating can be accompanied byREFERENCE:Kasper, D.L., et al., eds.. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.",

Groin pain can be acute (sudden in onset), or the pain can persist over time (chronic), depending on the specific cause. As with any pain, the characteristics of groin pain -- its precise location, timing, duration, etc. -- are important to determine the cause. Groin pain can arise due to trauma or injury, tumors, infections, hernias, or other conditions. Pain in the groin can also originate in areas other than the groin, such as the leg. This is known as radiating or referred pain.

Gum disease can also be referred to as periodontal (around the teeth) disease, periodontitis (inflammation of areas around the teeth), and gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). Gingivitis and periodontitis are two different types of gum disease that vary in severity. Mild gum disease (gingivitis) simply causes redness or occasional bleeding during toothbrushing. In more serious cases of gum disease, there is damage to the soft tissues and bones that support the teeth (periodontitis), leading to separation of the teeth from the gums. The separated areas, or pockets, easily become irritated and inflamed. Severe cases of gum disease can result in tooth loss.Improper dental hygiene is a major cause of gum disease. The normal, healthy mouth contains many bacteria. These bacteria form plaque on the teeth that can harden to form tartar (also called calculus) when not removed by proper brushing and flossing. Plaque and tartar cause inflammation of the surrounding tissues. There are several conditions that can result in an increased risk for gum disease, including cigarette,, AIDS, hormonal changes in women (in,, or around), and any condition that weakens the immune system.Another type of gum disease is caused by infections.

Despite the name, morning sickness or nausea can strike at any time during the day or night. Nausea of pregnancy usually starts about the sixth week of pregnancy, but some women may experience it earlier. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a term that refers to an unusually severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy that often requires hospitalization.Eating certain foods or experiencing certain smells may bring on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Being pregnant with twins or multiples is a risk factor for having morning sickness, possibly due to higher hormone levels. Other risk factors for morning sickness include a family or personal history of morning sickness, a history of migraine headaches, and a history of. Carrying a girl may slightly increase the risk.The exact cause of morning sickness is not understood, but it is believed to be due to the hormonal changes that occur in early pregnancy. For example, early in pregnancy, levels of the hormones estrogen and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) rise.  There is also an enhanced sense of smell and sensitivity to odors in early pregnancy, which might contribute to nausea. It is possible that some women have a so-called sensitive stomach, meaning they are more sensitive to the hormonal changes of pregnancy than others. While there is no evidence to prove that this is true, some researchers have proposed that morning sickness might result from an abnormal response toearly in pregnancy.REFERENCE:Kasper, D.L., et al., eds..

"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Symptoms and Signs" : " symptoms vary widely, and a description of typicalsymptoms is difficult. All the symptoms involve changes in neurologic functioning, but there are striking differences among patients in the type, severity, and frequency of these symptoms. Different disease patterns such as relapsing-remitting (RR), primary-progressive (PP), secondary-progressive (SP), and progressive-relapsing (PR) classify the condition according to the development and progression of symptoms over time. Relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis is the most common type, in which symptoms (exacerbations of the condition) are followed by periods of time with reduced or no symptoms. These relatively symptom-free periods, known as remissions, can last for days or for many years.Some cases of multiple sclerosis are so mild that the condition is difficult to diagnose. In other cases, there is a gradual decline in functioning through the years, and early signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be difficult to appreciate.  In very rare cases, symptoms can be so severe and rapidly progressing as to be fatal within a short time (known as malignant or fulminant MS). Symptoms can be related to one body part or may involve multiple areas of the body. They may be of short duration or may persist for a long time. Some symptoms of multiple sclerosis are mild and cause inconvenience; others may be severe and debilitating.Visual disturbances can be the first early symptom of MS in some people. The vision changes can include blurred vision, distortions, or loss of vision in one eye. The vision symptoms can be accompanied by eye pain. Other symptoms can include tingling, numbness, prickling pain, orin the arms and legs that may occur at one or multiple sites. Weakness in the arm and leg muscles may occur, and this can sometimes affect balance and posture, causing clumsiness or lack of coordination. Other symptoms include,, difficulties with speech,, heat intolerance, and loss of sensation. Sexual dysfunction and loss of bladder or bowel control can develop in more serious cases.Mental changes can also occur as symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Memory loss, decreased ability to concentrate, attention deficits, an inability to perform sequential tasks, and changes in judgment have all been reported., mania, paranoia, and uncontrollable urges to laugh or weep are other symptoms that have been described.MS is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the myelin sheath (protective covering) of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The exact reason that the autoimmune reaction occurs is not understood, but both genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role.REFERENCE:Luzzio, Christopher. Multiple Sclerosis.

"Insulin Resistance Symptoms and Signs" : " means that the cells of the body have become resistant to the action of the hormone insulin. Insulin, secreted by the pancreas, is critical for the body's use of glucose for energy. When the cells of the body do not respond appropriately to insulin, glucose from the bloodstream cannot be taken up by cells and used for fuel. Consequently, the pancreas tries to compensate by producing even more insulin.  When the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels rise. Insulin resistance is a risk factor for the development ofand its associated complications. Insulin resistance is a step in the development ofand often occurs years before a person develops diabetes. Insulin resistance has been referred to as.Insulin resistance typically does not produce any specific symptoms and is diagnosed by a blood test. Some symptoms and signs are described below that are often seen in people with the condition due to associated medical conditions.Genetic (inherited) factors are believed to play an important role in the cause of insulin resistance. Taking certain medications can also contribute to insulin resistance. Further, the following conditions have also been linked to a risk for developing insulin resistance:REFERENCE:Kasper, D.L., et al., eds.. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.",

Clubbing refers to swelling in the tip of the digit that results in loss of the normal angle seen between the nail and the nail bed. The fingertips appear broader and rounder when clubbing is present. While the exact mechanism that leads to clubbing is poorly understood, it is known to develop most often in people with conditions of the heart or lungs that decrease the total amount of oxygen in the blood. However, clubbing can also accompany malignancies and some gastrointestinal conditions. Clubbing may have a slow onset to the point where the individual is unaware of the change. It is usually painless but can rarely be accompanied by discomfort in the fingertips.

Fungal infection of the nails may cause changes in the nail itself and its appearance, including symptoms and signs such asFungal nails may appear brittle, broken, and lifted or separated from the nail bed. Changes in the nail appearance are typically the first signs and symptoms of fungal nails. The condition may also cause pain and disfigurement in some cases, although this is not common. In severe cases, fungal nails can cause problems with standing,, and exercising. Both oral and topical antifungal drugs may be used in treatment.A number of conditions can increase the risk that fungi infect the nails. Fungus that is caught from moist, wet areas are common causes in healthy people. Communal showers, such as those at a gym orpools, are common sources. Visiting nail salons that use inadequate sanitization of instruments (such as clippers, filers, and foot tubs) is another way that the infection may be spread. Living with family members who have fungal nails is another risk factor. Wearing tight-fitting, sweaty shoes associated with repetitive trauma to the toenails occurs in many athletes and increases the susceptibility to fungal nails. People withare more likely to have fungal nails, since the causative fungus may infect the toenails.

Itching can be diffuse (generalized all over the body) or localized -- all over or confined to a specific spot -- and there are many causes of diffuse and localized itching. Itching symptoms can be associated withItching may be most noticeable at night (nocturnal), during the day, or both. When there are itching symptoms, there can be a leathery or scaly texture to the skin depending on the cause.Itching can be caused by toxins on the skin (, such as from, poison oak, poison sumac, or grass oils), medications,disease, kidney disease, insect bites,(urticarial), rare forms of(mycosis fungoides and T-cell lymphomas), infections (includingand fungal infections such asand jock), irritation from clothing,, dermatitis herpetiformis,, and many other conditions, or it can remain unexplained. Infectious causes of itching include sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), parasites (such as, fleas,,, and lice), and viral rashes.Perhaps the best definition of itching is by the response it evokes -- it is a feeling that makes you want to scratch. Rash or redness can be present with itching from scratching or from the underlying condition. Medically, itching is known as pruritus.

By far the most common, however, is called. This type of fungus has a tendency to infect the skin and is therefore known as a dermatophyte.is a type of bacteria that infects the nail bed and results in a greenish color to the nails. Red or black (that may sometimes appear bruised) nails may result from a(a collection of blood) under the nail as a result of trauma (including ingrown toenails).Chronic medical conditions also can affect the appearance of the nails. Specific color changes in the nails can be suggestive ofor of,  kidney, heart, or lung conditions. This is why doctors pay specific attention to nails during a routine physical examination.Other, rare causes of discolored nails include the yellow nail syndrome, an inherited condition that results in slow-growing, yellowing, discolored nails and is associated with(swelling of tissues due to the accumulation of fluid) and lung diseases. Nails may also appear lightened to a whitish-yellow color if there has been separation of the nail from the nail bed, termed onycholysis.The skin, mucous membranes, and nails may appear blue when there is inadequate oxygenation of blood (cyanosis), but this is not true discoloration of the nail itself.REFERENCE:Kasper, D.L., et al., eds..

"Neonatal Jaundice" : " refers to a yellow staining of the skin and sclerae (the whites of the eyes) due to a buildup of the bile pigment,.  High bilirubin levels in the blood result in the characteristic yellowish discoloration of jaundice.Bilirubin comes from red blood cells. Normally, the body destroys some red blood cells. When this happens,, the oxygen-carrying molecule within the cells, is released into the blood and converted to bilirubin. In the fetus, the placenta removes bilirubin from the fetal bloodstream.  After the baby is born, theremoves bilirubin from the blood, modifies it, and excretes it into the bile. The bile flows into the intestine so that the bilirubin is eliminated in the stool.Many babies develop jaundice in the first few days of life that is typically worse at 2-4 days of age. This is known as physiological jaundice and typically goes away within two weeks. Mild jaundice can also result from. Severe jaundice in newborns results from medical conditions that cause an excessive turnover of red blood cells, including abnormal blood cell shapes and mismatch between maternal and fetal blood types. Certain medications and medical conditions can also slow down the process of removing bilirubin from the body and lead to jaundice.

Nausea (and vomiting) can be psychological or physical in origin. It can originate from problems in the brain or organs of the upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, small intestine,, pancreas, and gallbladder). Nausea also may be caused by diseases of many organs outside of the gastrointestinal system. Therefore, the diagnosis of the cause of prolonged nausea may not be easy. All stimuli that cause nausea work via the vomiting center in the brain, which gives rise to the sensation of nausea and coordinates the physical act of vomiting.Nausea symptoms are frequently difficult for people to describe. Nausea symptoms are not painful but very uncomfortable feelings that are felt in the chest, upper abdomen, or back of the throat.

"Osteoporosis Symptoms and Signs" : " most often causes no symptoms. The main symptom that osteoporosis can cause is pain as a result of a bone fracture. Other symptoms that osteoporosis can cause are loss of height, hunched posture, and a hump in the upper back (dowager's hump), each as a direct result of compression fracture of vertebrae in the spine.Interestingly, sometimes osteoporosis leads to bone fracture that causes no symptoms at all. Frequently, these arefractures in the elderly. When osteoporosis causes fracture of the spine, aside from long-term deformity, it can result in band-like pain on both sides of the body (typically back pain in the middle back or lower back) at the level of the spinal vertebrae that is broken.  Fracture of bone away from the spine causes pain and tenderness in the corresponding area of the fracture (wrist, foot, ankle, hip, etc.). There can also be swelling, redness, and bruising in the area.Signs of osteoporosis include evidence of bone thinning by X-ray testing,, or. Osteoporosis can then be confirmed by bone density testing (DEXA bone mineral density scan). Of note, osteoporosis can be present for years before any fracture occurs, which is precisely why bone density screening can be used to diagnose occult osteoporosis so that treatment can be initiated to prevent fractures.Osteoporosis is most often caused by aging.

"Rectal Bleeding" : " can be bright red, maroon in color, black and tarry, or occult (not visible to the naked eye). Causes of blood in the stool range from harmless, annoying conditions of the gastrointestinal tract such asand anal tears (anal fissures) from straining against hard stools withto serious conditions such as. Blood in the stool should be evaluated by a health care professional.Rectal bleeding (known medically as hematochezia) refers to passage of bright red blood from the anus, often mixed with stool and/or. Most rectal bleeding comes from the colon, rectum, or anus and can be associated with. The color of the blood during rectal bleeding often depends on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Generally, the closer the bleeding site is to the anus, the blood will be a brighter red. Thus, bleeding from the anus, rectum, and the sigmoid colon tend to be bright red, whereas bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon (transverse and right colon are several feet away from the anus) tend to be dark red or maroon colored.In some patients, bleeding can be black and tarry (sticky) and foul smelling. The black, smelly, and tarry stool is called melena. Melena occurs when the blood is in the colon long enough for the bacteria in the colon to break it down into chemicals (hematin) that are black. Therefore, melena usually signifies bleeding is from the upper gastrointestinal tract (for example, bleeding from ulcers in the stomach or the duodenum or from the small intestine) because the blood usually is in the gastrointestinal tract for a longer period of time before it exits the body. Sometimes melena may occur with bleeding from the right colon. On the other hand, blood from the sigmoid colon and the rectum usually does not stay in the colon long enough for the bacteria to turn it black. Rarely, massive bleeding from the right colon, from the small intestine, or from ulcers of the stomach or duodenum can cause rapid transit of the blood through the gastrointestinal tract and result in bright red rectal bleeding. In these situations, the blood is moving through the colon so rapidly that there is not enough time for the bacteria to turn the blood black.Sometimes, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract can be too slow to cause either rectal bleeding or melena. In these patients, bleeding is occult (not visible to the naked eye). The blood is found only by testing the stool for blood (fecal occult blood testing) in the laboratory. Occult bleeding has many of the same causes as rectal bleeding and may result in the same symptoms as rectal bleeding. It is often associated withthat is due to loss of iron along with the blood (anemia).Causes of rectal bleeding include hemorrhoids,, proctitis,, diverticulosis,, rectal ulcer, rectal prolapse, ischemic, angiodysplasia, rectal trauma,,, proctitis from, and others.For more information, please see theandarticles.REFERENCE:Kasper, D.L., et al., eds..

Other symptoms that can occur include palsy of the facial nerve, leading to loss of muscle tone on one or both sides of the face.may develop and cause headache and stiffness of the neck. Other possible symptoms includeand heart.If this condition is not treated, a later stage of the illness, known as the late disseminated stage, may develop in the following months to years. Symptoms of this later stage can include intermittent attacks of, with joint swelling and pain. Neurological symptoms, such as numbness and tingling in the extremities, shooting pains, and short-term memory problems have also been reported in the later stages.Lyme disease is a bacterial illness spread by a tick bite.

Symptoms also vary widely in severity among affected people.General symptoms associated with lupus includeWeight changes can also occur. More specific symptoms include skin changes (see below), ulcers of the mouth and nose, photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight), and decreased circulation to the fingers and toes with cold exposure.is a manifestation of this change in circulation.The most typical skin symptom of lupus is the development of the so-called butterfly rash over the nose and cheeks. The rash is painless and does not. It may worsen with sun exposure, like other inflammatory processes associated with the disease. People with discoid lupus have involvement of only the skin. Those with this condition often have a rash over the face and scalp that can lead, with time, to scarring and(alopecia).People with lupus can have a decrease in platelets and white blood cells, increasing the risks for bleeding and infection.may also be present. Widespread inflammation in different areas of the body can have serious consequences, including(inflammation of blood vessels, which can impair circulation and oxygen delivery), pleuritis (inflammation of the lining of the lungs), and(inflammation of the lining sac of the heart). Pleuritis and pericarditis can result in. Other manifestations of lupus in the lung can include(fluid collection in the space surrounding the lungs) and interstitial lung disease. In the heart,(inflammation of the heart muscle) can occur.Inflammation in the kidneys due to lupus (lupus nephritis) can cause leakage of protein into the urine (proteinuria), fluid retention,, and even acute or chronic. This can lead to worsening of fatigue and swelling of the legs and feet.Involvement of the brain can cause personality changes, thought disorders (psychosis), seizures, and even. Lupus-related nerve damage can cause numbness, tingling, and weakness of the involved body parts or extremities.REFERENCE:Bartels, Christie M. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Medscape.com.

Bowel disturbances as seen withmay occur, includingand. Irritability, mood changes,, forgetfulness, nervousness, lack of concentration, andare emotional symptoms of fibromyalgia.Genetics has been shown to play a role in the causation of fibromyalgia. While stress does not cause the condition, the symptoms often become evident after stressful events. These events may be emotional (such as a traumatic life event), physical (such as car accidents), or medical (for example, certain infections, illnesses, or conditions that cause). The symptoms are thought to arise from an abnormality in the manner in which the brain and spinal cord process pain sensations. This results in a lower threshold at which stimuli cause pain or discomfort in people with fibromyalgia. Further, pain can be more intense because of abnormalities in the central nervous system and in pain processing.REFERENCE:Kasper, D.L., et al., eds.. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.",
"Fainting" : " (syncope) is the partial or complete loss of consciousness with interruption of awareness of oneself and ones surroundings. When the loss of consciousness is temporary and there is spontaneous recovery, it is referred to as syncope or, in nonmedical terms, fainting. Syncope accounts for one in every 30 visits to an emergency room. It is pronounced sin-ko-pea.Syncope is due to a temporary reduction in blood flow and therefore a shortage of oxygen to the brain. This leads to lightheadedness or a black out episode, a loss of consciousness. Temporary impairment of the blood supply to the brain can be caused by heart conditions and by conditions that do not directly involve the heart.REFERENCE:Kasper, D.L., et al., eds.. United States: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015.: Syncope is most commonly caused by conditions that do not directly involve the heart. These conditions include the following:: Heart conditions that can cause syncope or fainting due to temporary loss of consciousness include:can cause fainting by altering blood pressure or by affecting the heart.",

In some cases, overgrowth of the fungus results in the flakiness of the skin characteristic of dandruff. The reasons for the overgrowth of fungus are unclear but may be related to increased oil production, hormonal changes,, neurologic disorders such as, recovery from chronic conditions such asor, suppression of the immune system, and infrequent shampooing. There is also some evidence that dandruff may run in families. Scalp flakiness may also be caused byor other skin ailments or infections.REFERENCE:Kasper, D.L., et al., eds..

Usually foreign bodies are metal, glass, or organic material (such as insects). Depending upon the size and type of material that gets into the eye, it may be a minor irritation or can cause serious medical consequences. Foreign bodies may cause bleeding into the eye. Bleeding into the whites of the eye is due to blood collection in or under the conjunctiva, the lining membranes of the eye.  Blood over the iris (colored part) of the eye is known as a hyphema. This is often a sign of a serious eye injury.Using protective eyewear can prevent many cases of foreign body in the eye. A foreign body in the eye often occurs while being in an environment that exposes one to small flying pieces of debris. Metal or glass shards are types of material that can become lodged in the eye. High-speed machines like drills and saws, hammering, and explosions are all potential causes.REFERENCE:Bashour, Mounir. Corneal Foreign Body. Medscape.com.

"Fever" : " is considered a temperature above 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C). A feverish sensation, however, may occur when the body temperature is above the average normal of 98.6 degrees F. (37 degrees C).Fever is part of the body's own disease-fighting arsenal. Rising body temperatures apparently are capable of killing off many disease-producing organisms. For that reason, low fevers should normally go untreated.  Although, if the fever is accompanied by any other troubling symptoms, you may need to see your doctor to be certain. As fevers range to 104 F and above, however, there can be unwanted consequences, particularly for children. These can include delirium and convulsions. A fever of this sort demands immediate home treatment and then medical attention. Home treatment possibilities include the use of aspirin or, in children, nonaspirin painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), cool baths, or sponging to reduce the fever while seeking medical help. Fever may occur with almost any type of infection of illness. The temperature is measured with a thermometer.Fever is also called pyrexia.REFERENCE:Kasper, D.L., et al., eds..
