                                "description": "Yawning is a mostly involuntary process of opening the mouth and breathing in deeply, filling the lungs with air. It is a very natural response to being tired. In fact, yawning is usually triggered by sleepiness or fatigue. Some yawns are short, and some last for several seconds before an open-mouthed exhale. Watery eyes, stretching, or audible sighs may accompany yawning.Researchers aren’t exactly sure why yawning occurs, but common triggers include fatigue and boredom. Yawns may also occur when you talk about yawning or see or hear someone else yawn. It is believed that contagious yawning may have something to do with social communication. In addition, a study published in the Applied Journal of Basic Medical Research suggests that yawning may help cool the temperature of the brain.Excessive yawning is yawning that occurs more than once per minute. Although excessive yawning is usually attributed to being sleepy or bored, it may be a symptom of an underlying medical problem. Certain conditions can cause a vasovagal reaction, which results in excessive yawning. During a vasovagal reaction, there is increased activity in the vagus nerve. This nerve runs from the brain down to the throat and into the abdomen. When the vagus nerve becomes more active, heart rate and blood pressure drop significantly. The reaction can indicate anything from a sleep disorder to a serious heart condition.Talk to your doctor if you’ve noticed a sudden increase in your yawning, especially if you’ve been yawning frequently for no apparent reason. Only your doctor can determine whether or not the excessive yawning is occurring as a result of a medical problem. " ,
                 
                                "diagnosis": "To identify the cause of excessive yawning, your doctor may first ask you about your sleep habits. They will want to make sure that you are getting adequate restful sleep. This can help them determine whether your excessive yawning is occurring as a result of being fatigued or having a sleep disorder. After ruling out sleep issues, your doctor will perform diagnostic tests to find another possible cause for excessive yawning. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the tests that may be used. An EEG measures the electrical activity in the brain. It can help your doctor diagnose epilepsy and other conditions affecting the brain. Your doctor may also order an MRI scan. This test uses powerful magnets and radio waves to produce detailed images of the body, which can help doctors visualize and assess bodily structures. These pictures are often used to diagnose spinal cord and brain disorders, such as tumors and multiple sclerosis. An MRI scan is also beneficial for evaluating the function of the heart and detecting heart problems.",
                 
                                "treatment": "If medications are causing excessive yawning, your doctor may recommend a lower dosage. Make sure to discuss this with your doctor before making any changes to your medications. You should never stop taking medications without approval from your doctor. If excessive yawning is occurring as a result of a sleep disorder, your doctor may recommend sleep-aid medications or techniques for getting more restful sleep. These may include:   using a breathing device, exercising to reduce stress, adhering to a regular sleep schedule. If excessive yawning is a symptom of a serious medical condition, such as epilepsy or liver failure, then the underlying problem must be treated immediately."

                 "name": "Abdominal tenderness",
                 "description": "Abdominal tenderness, or point tenderness in your abdomen, is when pressure on an area of your abdomen causes pain. It may        also feel sore and tender. If the removal of pressure causes pain, then that’s known as rebound tenderness or Blumberg sign. Point tenderness is often a sign that something is wrong with one or more organs in the area. All disorders that cause abdominal point tenderness are medical emergencies. Seek emergency medical help if you have abdominal tenderness, especially if you also have a fever. Untreated abdominal point tenderness can be life-threatening. Some conditions that may cause abdominal point tenderness are Appendicitis can result in a ruptured appendix and peritonitis (inflammation of the inner lining of the abdomen). An ectopic pregnancy can cause severe blood loss, which can be fatal. A twisted fallopian tube or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can cause pelvic scarring and infertility. Infections in the digestive tract (diverticulitis) can be fatal",
                 
                 "diagnosis": "Your doctor can examine the area by touch. The region where there’s pain may show an issue with certain organs. For example: right upper quadrant (liver and gallbladder) left upper quadrant (stomach and duodenum) right lower quadrant (appendix) left lower quadrant (final segment of colon or digestive tract)The most well-known type of point tenderness is McBurney point. It is located in the right lower quadrant, in the area of your appendix. Point tenderness over McBurney point means your appendix is very inflamed. At this point, your appendix is at risk for rupturing. Problems with pelvic organs, including the ovaries and fallopian tubes, can also cause right or left lower quadrant tenderness.",
                 
                 "treatment": "Treatment for abdominal point tenderness depends on the underlying cause. Avoid taking aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen for abdominal pain as this increases your risk for stomach ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. It may also worsen your condition.Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can cause severe dehydration and low blood pressure. If you’ve been experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, you may also get fluids and electrolytes intravenously. Your doctor will introduce these fluids through a vein in your arm or hand. These fluids help maintain your blood pressure and acid-base balance. Severe dehydration can cause dangerously low blood pressure (shock). Shock reduces blood flow to all vital organs. It can also damage your kidneys, heart, and brain. "

Most people describe bloating as feeling full, tight, or swollen in the abdomen. Your abdomen may also be swollen (distended), hard, and painful. Bloating is often accompanied by: pain excessive gas (flatulence) frequent burping or belching abdominal rumbling or gurgles. Abdominal bloating can interfere with your ability to work and participate in social or recreational activities. According to the University of North Carolina, people who do experience abdominal bloating use more sick days, visit the doctor more often, and take more medications than other people. Bloating is common among both adults and children.",

                 "description": "An abdominal mass is an abnormal growth in the abdomen. An abdominal mass causes visible swelling and may change the shape of the abdomen. A person with an abdominal mass may notice weight gain and symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, pain, and bloating.Masses in the abdomen are often described by their location. The abdomen is divided into four sections called quadrants. An abdominal mass may occur in the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, right lower quadrant, or left lower quadrant. The stomach is also divided into two sections: the epigastric section and the periumbilical section. The periumbilical section is located below and around the belly button; the epigastric section is located above the belly button and below the ribs. Abdominal masses are often treatable. However, health complications may arise depending on the cause of the mass.",
                 "diagnosis": "After going over your medical history, including your symptoms and when they began, the doctor will have a good idea of where the mass is located. This will lead him or her to determine which organs or surrounding structures are affected by the abdominal mass. During a physical examination, your doctor will ask that you lie back while he or she gently presses on various areas of your abdomen. This examination helps the doctor to locate the mass or any enlarged organs, and to see if and where you are experiencing tenderness. An imaging test is usually ordered to determine the size and location of the mass. An imaging test can also determine what type of mass is in the abdomen. Imaging tests that are commonly ordered for this purpose are: abdominal computed axial tomography (CAT) scan, abdominal X-ray, abdominal ultrasound. When imaging tests are not enough, the doctor may wish to take a closer look at the area involved. This is especially true if the digestive system is involved. To look in the digestive system, the doctor uses a small microscope housed in a tube-like structure. This tube is inserted into your colon (an organ of your digestive system). This procedure is called a colonoscopy. A blood test (complete blood count) may also be ordered to check your hormone levels and for the presence of infection. Women who have ovarian cysts will require a special imaging scan called a transvaginal ultrasound. Unlike an abdominal ultrasound, which views organs on the inside by sliding a probe over the abdomen, a transvaginal ultrasound is performed by inserting a probe into the vagina. This allows the doctor to have a closer look at the uterus and ovaries.",
                 "treatment": "Depending on the cause of the mass, treatment may consist of medication, surgery, or specialized care. The most common treatment options to eliminate abdominal masses include:medications to correct hormones, surgical removal of the mass, methods to shrink the mass, chemotherapy, radiation therapy. If you have cysts in the abdomen that are large and/or causing considerable pain, your doctor may opt to remove them through surgery. Surgical removal is also used to remove tumors. However, if removal is dangerous, the surgeon may suggest methods to shrink the mass instead. Chemotherapy or radiation treatment may also be suggested to shrink the mass. Once the mass reaches a smaller size, the doctor may opt to end the chemotherapy and remove the mass through surgery. This option is often used for people who have cancerous abdominal masses. Masses that are caused by changes in hormones, such as ovarian cysts, may be treated through hormone replacement medication or low dose hormone birth control pills."

                 "name": "Abdominal Pain",
                 "description": "Abdominal pain is pain that occurs between the chest and pelvic regions. Abdominal pain can be crampy, achy, dull, intermittent or sharp. It’s also called a stomachache. Inflammation or diseases that affect the organs in the abdomen can cause abdominal pain. Major organs located in the abdomen include: Intestines (small and large), kidneys, appendix (a part of the large intestine), spleen, stomach, gallbladder, liver, pancreas, Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections that affect the stomach and intestines may also cause significant abdominal pain.",
                 "diagnosis": "The cause of abdominal pain can be diagnosed through a series of tests. Before ordering tests, your doctor will do a physical examination. This includes gently pressing down on various areas of your abdomen to check for tenderness and swelling. This information, combined with the severity of the pain and its location within the abdomen, will help your doctor determine which tests to order. Imaging tests, such as MRI scans, ultrasounds, and X-rays, are used to view organs, tissues, and other structures in the abdomen in detail. These tests can help diagnose tumors, fractures, ruptures, and inflammation.",
                 "treatment": "Not all forms of abdominal pain are preventable. However, you can minimize the risk of developing abdominal pain by doing the following: Eat a healthy diet, Drink water frequently, Exercise regularly, Eat smaller meals. If you have an intestinal disorder, such as Crohn’s disease, follow the diet your doctor has given you to minimize discomfort. If you have GERD, don’t eat within two hours of bedtime. Lying down too soon after eating may cause heartburn and abdominal pain. Try waiting at least two hours after eating before lying down."

                 "name": "Abdominal Rigidity",
                 "description":"Abdominal rigidity is a state of stiffness of your stomach muscles that worsens when you touch (or someone else touches) your abdomen. This is an involuntary response to prevent pain caused by pressure on your abdomen. Another term for this protective mechanism is guarding. This symptom isn’t the same as intentionally flexing your abdominal muscles or the rigidity associated with severe gas. Guarding is a completely involuntary response of the muscles. In other words, you have no control over it. It’s a sign that your body is trying to protect itself from pain. It can be a symptom of a very serious and even life-threatening medical condition. If you have abdominal rigidity, you should see your doctor right away. Abdominal rigidity and pain often occur together. Every condition that causes abdominal pain can cause guarding. Disorders of your abdominal organs can cause abdominal pain. Organs inside your abdomen include your liver, pancreas, gallbladder, stomach, small and large intestines, aorta (main artery), vena cava (main vein), and kidneys and ureters. One of the most common abdominal causes of rigidity is appendicitis. Problems with your pelvic organs can also cause abdominal pain. Your pelvic organs include your bladder and lower ureters, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries (in women), prostate gland (in men), and rectum. It’s less common to find diseases of the lower lung as a cause of abdominal pain and rigidity, but it does sometimes happen. The location of pain varies with the location of the organ that’s causing the problem. For medical purposes, your stomach is divided into four sections called quadrants. For instance, stomach ulcers can cause pain in the left, upper quadrant of your abdomen. Gallstones can cause right, upper quadrant pain because they are in the upper right part of your abdomen. Abdominal pain can also travel to other areas of the abdomen. Appendicitis can start off as right, lower quadrant pain, but the pain can start to move toward your belly button. The causes of abdominal pain (and rigidity) can be different based on age. Adults (most common in elderly adults) may experience an abscess inside the abdomen, cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation), cancer, bowel obstruction or blockage, or a perforation or hole in the intestines, stomach, or gall bladder. Pancreatitis, trauma to the abdomen, and peritonitis can also lead to abdominal pain and rigidity. Adolescents sometimes have painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea), pelvic inflammatory disease (from sexually transmitted infections), ovarian cysts, or peritonitis. Adolescent women may also have abdominal pain and rigidity if they’re pregnant (including an ectopic pregnancy). Older children may experience urinary tract infections (UTIs), appendicitis, or may have ingested toxins (poisons). Infants can have colic, gastroenteritis (digestive irritation caused by a virus), a viral infection, or pyloric stenosis (narrowing of the stomach outlet).",
                 "diagnosis":"If you have involuntary abdominal rigidity, you should see a doctor right away to rule out serious problems. Although something as minor as a stomach virus could cause guarding, you won’t know until your doctor gives you a proper diagnosis. Don’t attempt to take medication to dull the pain before seeing your doctor. It will alter the pain pattern and make it more difficult for your doctor to diagnose your condition. When you talk to your doctor, it’s helpful for you to be aware of when the symptoms started, the qualities of the pain (if it’s dull, sharp, occurring off and on, or travels to another area), how long the pain lasts, and what you were doing when the rigidity/pain began. Ask yourself what makes it better and what makes it worse. Your doctor will also want to know any other symptoms you may have and when they started, and the time of your last meal (in case you need surgery). Being aware of these factors will help your doctor establish your diagnosis. The first steps in finding the cause of abdominal rigidity are to discuss your medical history. A physical exam will usually reveal the cause. Your doctor may also order blood tests, including: CBC (complete blood count), serum electrolytes (potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate), BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine (indication of kidney functioning), ultrasound scan of your abdominal or pelvic regions, liver function tests, urinalysis, test for blood in your stool Additional tests you may need include abdominal X-rays to evaluate for obstruction or perforation, an abdominal ultrasound, or an abdominal CT scan.",
                 "treatment":"The treatment your doctor chooses will depend on the cause of the abdominal rigidity. Obviously, treatment for colic in an infant will be different than treatment for cancer, for instance. While minor conditions may only require monitoring, self-care, and prescription antibiotics, more serious causes of abdominal rigidity could warrant more aggressive treatments. Depending on your diagnosis, aggressive treatment can include intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration, nasogastric (feeding) tube to provide nourishment, intravenous antibiotic, or surgery."
